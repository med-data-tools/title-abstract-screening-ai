Machine Learning and Nomogram Prognostic Modeling for 2-Year Head and Neck Cancer-Specific Survival Using Electronic Health Record Data: A Multisite Study.;PURPOSE: There is limited knowledge of the prediction of 2-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) in the head and neck cancer (HNC) population. The aim of this study is to develop and validate machine learning models and a nomogram for the prediction of 2-year CSS in patients with HNC using real-world data collected by major teaching and tertiary referral hospitals in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data collected in oncology information systems at multiple NSW Cancer Centres were extracted for 2,953 eligible adults diagnosed between 2000 and 2017 with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Death data were sourced from the National Death Index using record linkage. Machine learning and Cox regression/nomogram models were developed and internally validated in Python and R, respectively. RESULTS: Machine learning models demonstrated highest performance (C-index) in the larynx and nasopharynx cohorts (0.82), followed by the oropharynx (0.79) and the hypopharynx and oral cavity cohorts (0.73). In the whole HNC population, C-indexes of 0.79 and 0.70 and Brier scores of 0.10 and 0.27 were reported for the machine learning and nomogram model, respectively. Cox regression analysis identified age, T and N classification, and time-corrected biologic equivalent dose in two gray fractions as independent prognostic factors for 2-year CSS. N classification was the most important feature used for prediction in the machine learning model followed by age. CONCLUSION: Machine learning and nomogram analysis predicted 2-year CSS with high performance using routinely collected and complete clinical information extracted from oncology information systems. These models function as visual decision-making tools to guide radiotherapy treatment decisions and provide insight into the prediction of survival outcomes in patients with HNC.;1
Evaluation of the Clinical Utility of the Bone Metastases Ensemble Trees for Survival Decision Support Platform (BMETS-DSP): A Case-Based Pilot Assessment.;PURPOSE: The Bone Metastases Ensemble Trees for Survival Decision Support Platform (BMETS-DSP) provides patient-specific survival predictions and evidence-based recommendations to guide multidisciplinary management for symptomatic bone metastases. We assessed the clinical utility of the BMETS-DSP through a pilot prepost design in a simulated clinical environment. METHODS: Ten Radiation Oncology physicians reviewed 55 patient cases at two time points: without and then with the use of BMETS-DSP. Assessment included 12-month survival estimate, confidence in and likelihood of sharing estimates with patients, and recommendations for open surgery, systemic therapy, hospice referral, and radiotherapy (RT) regimen. Paired statistics compared pre- versus post-DSP outcomes. Reported statistical significance is P < .05. RESULTS: Pre- versus post-DSP, overestimation of true minus estimated survival time was significantly reduced (mean difference -2.1 [standard deviation 4.1] v -1 month [standard deviation 3.5]). Prediction accuracy was significantly improved at cut points of < 3 (72 v 79%), </= 6 (64 v 71%), and >/= 12 months (70 v 81%). Median ratings of confidence in and likelihood of sharing prognosis significantly increased. Significantly greater concordance was seen in matching use of 1-fraction RT with the true survival < 3 months (70 v 76%) and < 10-fraction RT with the true survival < 12 months (55 v 62%) and appropriate use of open surgery (47% v 53%), without significant changes in selection of hospice referral or systemic therapy. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrates that BMETS-DSP significantly improved physician survival estimation accuracy, prognostic confidence, likelihood of sharing prognosis, and use of prognosis-appropriate RT regimens in the care of symptomatic bone metastases, supporting future multi-institutional validation of the platform.;1
Automated clinical decision support system with deep learning dose prediction and NTCP models to evaluate treatment complications in patients with esophageal cancer.;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate how accurate our deep learning (DL) dose prediction models for intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and pencil beam scanning (PBS) treatments, when chained with normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models, are at identifying esophageal cancer patients who are at high risk of toxicity and should be switched to proton therapy (PT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two U-Net were created, for photon (XT) and proton (PT) plans, respectively. To estimate the dose distribution for each patient, they were trained on a database of 40 uniformly planned patients using cross validation and a circulating test set. These models were combined with a NTCP model for postoperative pulmonary complications. The NTCP model used the mean lung dose, age, histology type, and body mass index as predicting variables. The treatment choice is then done by using a DeltaNTCP threshold between XT and PT plans. Patients with DeltaNTCP >/= 10% were referred to PT. RESULTS: Our DL models succeed in predicting dose distributions with a mean error on the mean dose to the lungs (MLD) of 1.14 +/- 0.93% for XT and 0.66 +/- 0.48% for PT. The complete automated workflow (DL chained with NTCP) achieved 100% accuracy in patient referral. The average residual (DeltaNTCP ground truth - DeltaNTCP predicted) is 1.43 +/- 1.49%. CONCLUSION: This study evaluates our DL dose prediction models in a broader patient referral context and demonstrates their ability to support clinical decisions.;1
Infrastructure platform for privacy-preserving distributed machine learning development of computer-assisted theragnostics in cancer.;INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence suggests that data-driven support tools have found their way into clinical decision-making in a number of areas, including cancer care. Improving them and widening their scope of availability in various differing clinical scenarios, including for prognostic models derived from retrospective data, requires co-ordinated data sharing between clinical centres, secondary analyses of large multi-institutional clinical trial data, or distributed (federated) learning infrastructures. A systematic approach to utilizing routinely collected data across cancer care clinics remains a significant challenge due to privacy, administrative and political barriers. METHODS: An information technology infrastructure and web service software was developed and implemented which uses machine learning to construct clinical decision support systems in a privacy-preserving manner across datasets geographically distributed in different hospitals. The infrastructure was deployed in a network of Australian hospitals. A harmonized, international ontology-linked, set of lung cancer databases were built with the routine clinical and imaging data at each centre. The infrastructure was demonstrated with the development of logistic regression models to predict major cardiovascular events following radiation therapy. RESULTS: The infrastructure implemented forms the basis of the Australian computer-assisted theragnostics (AusCAT) network for radiation oncology data extraction, reporting and distributed learning. Four radiation oncology departments (across seven hospitals) in New South Wales (NSW) participated in this demonstration study. Infrastructure was deployed at each centre and used to develop a model predicting for cardiovascular admission within a year of receiving curative radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer. A total of 10,417 lung cancer patients were identified with 802 being eligible for the model. Twenty features were chosen for analysis from the clinical record and linked registries. After selection, 8 features were included and a logistic regression model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.70 and C-index of 0.65 on out-of-sample data. CONCLUSION: The infrastructure developed was demonstrated to be usable in practice between clinical centres to harmonize routinely collected oncology data and develop models with federated learning. It provides a promising approach to enable further research studies in radiation oncology using real world clinical data.;1
Applying Artificial Neural Networks to Develop a Decision Support Tool for Tis-4N0M0 Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy.;PURPOSE: Clear evidence indicating whether surgery or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is best for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is lacking. SBRT has many advantages. We used artificial neural networks (NNs) to predict treatment outcomes for patients with NSCLC receiving SBRT, aiming to aid in decision making. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among consecutive patients receiving SBRT between 2005 and 2019 in our institution, we retrospectively identified those with Tis-T4N0M0 NSCLC. We constructed two NNs for prediction of overall survival (OS) and cancer progression in the first 5 years after SBRT, which were tested using an internal and an external test data set. We performed risk group stratification, wherein 5-year OS and cancer progression were stratified into three groups. RESULTS: In total, 692 patients in our institution and 100 patients randomly chosen in the external institution were enrolled. The NNs resulted in concordance indexes for OS of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.79), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.75), and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.76) and area under the curve for cancer progression of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.84), 0.72 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.83), and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.81) in the training, internal test, and external test data sets, respectively. The survival and cumulative incidence curves were significantly stratified. NNs selected low-risk cancer progression groups of 5.6%, 6.9%, and 7.0% in the training, internal test, and external test data sets, respectively, suggesting that 48% of patients with peripheral Tis-4N0M0 NSCLC can be at low-risk for cancer progression. CONCLUSION: Predictions of SBRT outcomes using NNs were useful for Tis-4N0M0 NSCLC. Our results are anticipated to open new avenues for NN predictions and provide decision-making guidance for patients and physicians.;1
Validation and extension of the METSSS score in a metastatic cancer patient cohort after palliative radiotherapy within the last phase of life.;"INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: Choosing the right treatment for the right patient in a setting of metastatic cancer disease remains a challenge. To facilitate clinical decision-making, predictive tools have been developed to personalize treatment. Here, we aim to assess the use of the recently proposed ""METSSS score"" as a prognostic tool for overall survival of cancer patients after palliative radiotherapy in the last phase of life. METHODS: All patients treated with palliative radiotherapy at the end-of-life at the Department of Radiation Oncology of the University Hospital Zurich between January 2010 and December 2019 were included in this study. Data on demographics, diagnosis, treatment and comorbidities was extracted from the treatment planning and the electronical medical records system. To statistically assess the validity of the ""METSSS score"", the mortality risk score was calculated, followed by stratification of all patients to prognostic risk groups. The prediction of the 1-year overall survival estimates was subsequently calculated. RESULTS: Over the past decade, 274 patients have received palliative radiotherapy during the end-of-life period. One third of patients was female (34%, n = 93). The most frequent primary tumor was lung cancer (n = 121, 44%), and 55% of patients (n = 152) had no comorbidities according to the Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index. The most common radiotherapy site was the brain and eye region (42%, n = 115). The median actual overall survival of all patients was 40 days from the start of radiotherapy. The ""METSSS score"" survival model predicted that 269 patients (98.1%) belong into the high-risk, four patients (1.5%) into the medium-risk, and one patient (0.4%) into the low-risk group. The predicted median 1-year overall survival was 10%. DISCUSSION: The METSSS score correctly predicted the survival of our end-of-life patient cohort by assigning them into the highest risk category, and it can therefore serve as a decision-making tool when assigning patient to symptomatic radiotherapy.";1
Artificial Intelligence-Guided Prediction of Dental Doses Before Planning of Radiation Therapy for Oropharyngeal Cancer: Technical Development and Initial Feasibility of Implementation.;"PURPOSE: The aim was to develop a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-guided clinical decision support system, to predict radiation doses to subsites of the mandible using diagnostic computed tomography scans acquired before any planning of head and neck radiation therapy (RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: A dose classifier was trained using RT plans from 86 patients with oropharyngeal cancer; the test set consisted of an additional 20 plans. The classifier was trained to predict whether mandible subsites would receive a mean dose >50 Gy. The AI predictions were prospectively evaluated and compared with those of a specialist head and neck radiation oncologist for 9 patients. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Lin concordance correlation coefficient were calculated to compare the AI predictions to those of the physician. RESULTS: In the test data set, the AI predictions had a PPV of 0.95 and NPV of 0.88. For 9 patients evaluated prospectively, there was a strong correlation between the predictions of the AI algorithm and physician (P = .72, P < .001). Comparing the AI algorithm versus the physician, the PPVs were 0.82 versus 0.25, and the NPVs were 0.94 versus 1.0, respectively. Concordance between physician estimates and final planned doses was 0.62; this was 0.71 between AI-based estimates and final planned doses. CONCLUSION: AI-guided decision support increased precision and accuracy of pre-RT dental dose estimates.";1
Multitask Learning Radiomics on Longitudinal Imaging to Predict Survival Outcomes following Risk-Adaptive Chemoradiation for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.;Medical imaging provides quantitative and spatial information to evaluate treatment response in the management of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). High throughput extraction of radiomic features on these images can potentially phenotype tumors non-invasively and support risk stratification based on survival outcome prediction. The prognostic value of radiomics from different imaging modalities and time points prior to and during chemoradiation therapy of NSCLC, relative to conventional imaging biomarker or delta radiomics models, remains uncharacterized. We investigated the utility of multitask learning of multi-time point radiomic features, as opposed to single-task learning, for improving survival outcome prediction relative to conventional clinical imaging feature model benchmarks. Survival outcomes were prospectively collected for 45 patients with unresectable NSCLC enrolled on the FLARE-RT phase II trial of risk-adaptive chemoradiation and optional consolidation PD-L1 checkpoint blockade (NCT02773238). FDG-PET, CT, and perfusion SPECT imaging pretreatment and week 3 mid-treatment was performed and 110 IBSI-compliant pyradiomics shape-/intensity-/texture-based features from the metabolic tumor volume were extracted. Outcome modeling consisted of a fused Laplacian sparse group LASSO with component-wise gradient boosting survival regression in a multitask learning framework. Testing performance under stratified 10-fold cross-validation was evaluated for multitask learning radiomics of different imaging modalities and time points. Multitask learning models were benchmarked against conventional clinical imaging and delta radiomics models and evaluated with the concordance index (c-index) and index of prediction accuracy (IPA). FDG-PET radiomics had higher prognostic value for overall survival in test folds (c-index 0.71 [0.67, 0.75]) than CT radiomics (c-index 0.64 [0.60, 0.71]) or perfusion SPECT radiomics (c-index 0.60 [0.57, 0.63]). Multitask learning of pre-/mid-treatment FDG-PET radiomics (c-index 0.71 [0.67, 0.75]) outperformed benchmark clinical imaging (c-index 0.65 [0.59, 0.71]) and FDG-PET delta radiomics (c-index 0.52 [0.48, 0.58]) models. Similarly, the IPA for multitask learning FDG-PET radiomics (30%) was higher than clinical imaging (26%) and delta radiomics (15%) models. Radiomics models performed consistently under different voxel resampling conditions. Multitask learning radiomics for outcome modeling provides a clinical decision support platform that leverages longitudinal imaging information. This framework can reveal the relative importance of different imaging modalities and time points when designing risk-adaptive cancer treatment strategies.;1
Neural network dose prediction for rectal spacer stratification in dose-escalated prostate radiotherapy.;PURPOSE: To develop a knowledge-based decision-support system capable of stratifying patients for rectal spacer (RS) insertion based on neural network predicted rectal dose, reducing the need for time- and resource-intensive radiotherapy (RT) planning. METHODS: Forty-four patients treated for prostate cancer were enrolled into a clinical trial (NCT03238170). Dose-escalated prostate RT plans were manually created for 30 patients with simulated boost volumes using a conventional treatment planning system (TPS) and used to train a hierarchically dense 3D convolutional neural network to rapidly predict RT dose distributions. The network was used to predict rectal doses for 14 unseen test patients, with associated toxicity risks calculated according to published data. All metrics obtained using the network were compared to conventionally planned values. RESULTS: The neural network stratified patients with an accuracy of 100% based on optimal rectal dose-volume histogram constraints and 78.6% based on mandatory constraints. The network predicted dose-derived grade 2 rectal bleeding risk within 95% confidence limits of -1.9% to +1.7% of conventional risk estimates (risk range 3.5%-9.9%) and late grade 2 fecal incontinence risk within -0.8% to +1.5% (risk range 2.3%-5.7%). Prediction of high-resolution 3D dose distributions took 0.7 s. CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility of using a neural network to provide rapid decision support for RS insertion prior to RT has been demonstrated, and the potential for time and resource savings highlighted. Directly after target and healthy tissue delineation, the network is able to (i) risk stratify most patients with a high degree of accuracy to prioritize which patients would likely derive greatest benefit from RS insertion and (ii) identify patients close to the stratification threshold who would require conventional planning.;1
Quantum deep reinforcement learning for clinical decision support in oncology: application to adaptive radiotherapy.;Subtle differences in a patient's genetics and physiology may alter radiotherapy (RT) treatment responses, motivating the need for a more personalized treatment plan. Accordingly, we have developed a novel quantum deep reinforcement learning (qDRL) framework for clinical decision support that can estimate an individual patient's dose response mid-treatment and recommend an optimal dose adjustment. Our framework considers patients' specific information including biological, physical, genetic, clinical, and dosimetric factors. Recognizing that physicians must make decisions amidst uncertainty in RT treatment outcomes, we employed indeterministic quantum states to represent human decision making in a real-life scenario. We paired quantum decision states with a model-based deep q-learning algorithm to optimize the clinical decision-making process in RT. We trained our proposed qDRL framework on an institutional dataset of 67 stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated on prospective adaptive protocols and independently validated our framework in an external multi-institutional dataset of 174 NSCLC patients. For a comprehensive evaluation, we compared three frameworks: DRL, qDRL trained in a Qiskit quantum computing simulator, and qDRL trained in an IBM quantum computer. Two metrics were considered to evaluate our framework: (1) similarity score, defined as the root mean square error between retrospective clinical decisions and the AI recommendations, and (2) self-evaluation scheme that compares retrospective clinical decisions and AI recommendations based on the improvement in the observed clinical outcomes. Our analysis shows that our framework, which takes into consideration individual patient dose response in its decision-making, can potentially improve clinical RT decision-making by at least about 10% compared to unaided clinical practice. Further validation of our novel quantitative approach in a prospective study will provide a necessary framework for improving the standard of care in personalized RT.;1
Improving Early Identification of Significant Weight Loss Using Clinical Decision Support System in Lung Cancer Radiation Therapy.;PURPOSE: Early identification of patients who may be at high risk of significant weight loss (SWL) is important for timely clinical intervention in lung cancer radiotherapy (RT). A clinical decision support system (CDSS) for SWL prediction was implemented within the routine clinical workflow and assessed on a prospective cohort of patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CDSS incorporated a machine learning prediction model on the basis of radiomics and dosiomics image features and was connected to a web-based dashboard for streamlined patient enrollment, feature extraction, SWL prediction, and physicians' evaluation processes. Patients with lung cancer (N = 37) treated with definitive RT without prior RT were prospectively enrolled in the study. Radiomics and dosiomics features were extracted from CT and 3D dose volume, and SWL probability (>/= 0.5 considered as SWL) was predicted. Two physicians predicted whether the patient would have SWL before and after reviewing the CDSS prediction. The physician's prediction performance without and with CDSS and prediction changes before and after using CDSS were compared. RESULTS: CDSS showed significantly better prediction accuracy than physicians (0.73 v 0.54) with higher specificity (0.81 v 0.50) but with lower sensitivity (0.55 v 0.64). Physicians changed their original prediction after reviewing CDSS prediction for four cases (three correctly and one incorrectly), for all of which CDSS prediction was correct. Physicians' prediction was improved with CDSS in accuracy (0.54-0.59), sensitivity (0.64-0.73), specificity (0.50-0.54), positive predictive value (0.35-0.40), and negative predictive value (0.76-0.82). CONCLUSION: Machine learning-based CDSS showed the potential to improve SWL prediction in lung cancer RT. More investigation on a larger patient cohort is needed to properly interpret CDSS prediction performance and its benefit in clinical decision making.;1
Modeling-Based Decision Support System for Radical Prostatectomy Versus External Beam Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer Incorporating an In Silico Clinical Trial and a Cost-Utility Study.;"The aim of this study is to build a decision support system (DSS) to select radical prostatectomy (RP) or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients. We used an individual state-transition model based on predictive models for estimating tumor control and toxicity probabilities. We performed analyses on a synthetically generated dataset of 1000 patients with realistic clinical parameters, externally validated by comparison to randomized clinical trials, and set up an in silico clinical trial for elderly patients. We assessed the cost-effectiveness (CE) of the DSS for treatment selection by comparing it to randomized treatment allotment. Using the DSS, 47.8% of synthetic patients were selected for RP and 52.2% for EBRT. During validation, differences with the simulations of late toxicity and biochemical failure never exceeded 2%. The in silico trial showed that for elderly patients, toxicity has more influence on the decision than TCP, and the predicted QoL depends on the initial erectile function. The DSS is estimated to result in cost savings (EUR 323 (95% CI: EUR 213-433)) and more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; 0.11 years, 95% CI: 0.00-0.22) than randomized treatment selection.";1
Prostate cancer trajectory-map: clinical decision support system for prognosis management of radical prostatectomy.;"PURPOSE: Prostate cancer has a low mortality rate and requires persistent treatment; however, treatment decisions are challenging. Because prostate cancer is complex, the outcomes warrant thorough follow-up evaluation for appropriate treatment. Electronic health records (EHRs) do not present intuitive information. This study aimed to develop a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for prognosis management of radical prostatectomy. METHODS: We used data from 5,199 prostate cancer patients from three hospitals' EHRs in South Korea, comprising laboratory results, surgery, medication, and radiation therapy. We used open source R for data preprocessing and development of web-based visualization system. We also used R for automatic calculation functionalities of two factors to visualize the data, e.g., Prostate-Specific Antigen Doubling Time (PSADT), and four Biochemical Recurrence (BCR) definitions: American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO), Phoenix, consecutive PSA > 0.2 ng/mL, and PSA > 0.2 ng/mL. RESULTS: We developed the Prostate Cancer Trajectory Map (PCT-Map) as a CDSS for intuitive visualization of serial data of PSA, testosterone, surgery, medication, radiation therapy, BCR, and PSADT. CONCLUSIONS: The PCT-Map comprises functionalities for BCR and PSADT and calculates and visualizes the newly added patient data automatically in a PCT-Map data format, thus optimizing the visualization of patient data and allowing clinicians to promptly access patient data to decide the appropriate treatment.";1
Evaluation of a National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines-Based Decision Support Tool in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Nonrandomized Clinical Trial.;"IMPORTANCE: The association of guideline-based decision support with the quality of care in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not known. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of exposure to the National Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCN) guidelines with guideline-concordant care and patients' decisional conflict. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A nonrandomized clinical trial, conducted at a tertiary care academic institution, enrolled patients from February 23, 2015, to September 28, 2017. Data analysis was conducted from July 19, 2019, to April 22, 2020. A cohort of 76 patients with NSCLC seen at diagnosis or disease progression and a retrospective cohort of 157 patients treated before the trial were included. Adherence to 6 NCCN recommendations were evaluated: (1) smoking cessation counseling, (2) adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage IB to IIB NSCLC after surgery, (3) pathologic mediastinal staging in patients with stage III NSCLC before surgery, (4) pathologic mediastinal staging in patients with stage III NSCLC before nonsurgical treatment, (5) definitive chemoradiotherapy for patients with stage III NSCLC not having surgery, and (6) molecular testing for epidermal growth factor receptor and anaplastic lymphoma kinase alterations for patients with stage IV NSCLC. Subgroup analysis was conducted to compare the rates of guideline concordance between the prospective and retrospective cohorts. Secondary end points included decisional conflict and satisfaction. INTERVENTIONS: An online tool customizing the NCCN guidelines to patients' clinical and pathologic features was used during consultation, facilitated by a trained coordinator. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Concordance of practice with 6 NCCN treatment recommendations on NSCLC and patients' decisional conflict. RESULTS: Of the 76 patients with NSCLC, 44 were men (57.9%), median age at diagnosis was 68 years (interquartile range [IQR], 41-87 years), and 59 patients (77.6%) had adenocarcinoma. In the retrospective cohort, 91 of 157 patients (58.0%) were men, median age at diagnosis was 66 years (IQR, 61-65 years), and 105 patients (66.9%) had adenocarcinoma. After the intervention, patients received more smoking cessation counseling (4 of 5 [80.0%] vs 1 of 24 [4.2%], P < .001) and less adjuvant chemotherapy (0 of 7 vs 7 of 11 [63.6%]; P = .012). There was no significant change in mutation testing of non-squamous cell stage IV disease (20 of 20 [100%] vs 48 of 57 [84.2%]; P = .10). There was no significant change in pathologic mediastinal staging or initial chemoradiotherapy for patients with stage III disease. After consultation with the tool, decisional conflict scores improved by a median of 20 points (IQR, 3-34; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that exposure to the NCCN guidelines is associated with increased guideline-concordant care for 2 of 6 preselected recommendations and improvement in decisional conflict.

Looking through the eyes of the multidisciplinary team: the design and clinical evaluation of a decision support system for lung cancer care.;BACKGROUND: Decision-making in lung cancer is complex due to a rapidly increasing amount of diagnostic data and treatment options. The need for timely and accurate diagnosis and delivery of care demands high-quality multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaboration and coordination. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can potentially support MDTs in constructing a shared mental model of a patient case. This enables the team to assess the strength and completeness of collected diagnostic data, stratification for the right personalized therapy driven by clinical stage and other treatment-influencing factors, and adapt care management strategies when needed. Current CDSSs often have a suboptimal fit into the decision-making workflow, which hampers their impact in clinical practice. METHODS: A CDSS for multidisciplinary decision-making in lung cancer was designed to support the abovementioned goals through presentation of relevant clinical data in line with existing mental model structures of the MDT members. The CDSS was tested in a simulated multidisciplinary tumor board meeting for primary diagnosis and treatment selection, based on de-identified primary lung cancer cases (n=8). Decision course analysis, eye-tracking data and questionnaires were used to assess the impact of the CDSS on constructing shared mental models to improve the decision-making process and outcome. RESULTS: The CDSS supported the team in their self-correcting capacity for accurate diagnosis and TNM classification. It enabled cross-validation of diagnostic findings, surfaced discordance between diagnostic tests and facilitated cancer staging according the diagnostic evidence, as well as spotting contra-indications for personalized treatment selection. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the potential of CDSS on clinical decision making, when these systems are properly designed in line with clinical thinking. The presented setup enables assessment of the impact of CDSS design on clinical decision making and optimization of CDSSs to maximize their effect on decision quality and confidence.;1
Clinical validation of a graphical method for radiation therapy plan quality assessment.;BACKGROUND: This work aims at clinically validating a graphical tool developed for treatment plan assessment, named SPIDERplan, by comparing the plan choices based on its scoring with the radiation oncologists (RO) clinical preferences. METHODS: SPIDERplan validation was performed for nasopharynx pathology in two steps. In the first step, three ROs from three Portuguese radiotherapy departments were asked to blindly evaluate and rank the dose distributions of twenty pairs of treatment plans. For plan ranking, the best plan from each pair was selected. For plan evaluation, the qualitative classification of 'Good', 'Admissible with minor deviations' and 'Not Admissible' were assigned to each plan. In the second step, SPIDERplan was applied to the same twenty patient cases. The tool was configured for two sets of structures groups: the local clinical set and the groups of structures suggested in international guidelines for nasopharynx cancer. Group weights, quantifying the importance of each group and incorporated in SPIDERplan, were defined according to RO clinical preferences and determined automatically by applying a mixed linear programming model for implicit elicitation of preferences. Intra- and inter-rater ROs plan selection and evaluation were assessed using Brennan-Prediger kappa coefficient. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the plans were qualitatively evaluated by the ROs as 'Good'. Concerning intra- and inter-rater variabilities of plan selection, fair agreements were obtained for most of the ROs. For plan evaluation, substantial agreements were verified in most cases. The choice of the best plan made by SPIDERplan was identical for all sets of groups and, in most cases, agreed with RO plan selection. Differences between RO choice and SPIDERplan analysis only occurred in cases for which the score differences between the plans was very low. A score difference threshold of 0.005 was defined as the value below which two plans are considered of equivalent quality. CONCLUSION: Generally, SPIDERplan response successfully reproduced the ROs plan selection. SPIDERplan assessment performance can represent clinical preferences based either on manual or automatic group weight assignment. For nasopharynx cases, SPIDERplan was robust in terms of the definitions of structure groups, being able to support different configurations without losing accuracy.;1
A clinical decision support system learned from data to personalize treatment recommendations towards preventing breast cancer metastasis.;"OBJECTIVE: A Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) that can amass Electronic Health Record (EHR) and other patient data holds promise to provide accurate classification and guide treatment choices. Our objective is to develop the Decision Support System for Making Personalized Assessments and Recommendations Concerning Breast Cancer Patients (DPAC), which is a CDSS learned from data that recommends the optimal treatment decisions based on a patient's features. METHOD: We developed a Bayesian network architecture called Causal Modeling with Internal Layers (CAMIL), and an algorithm called Treatment Feature Interactions (TFI), which learns from data the interactions needed in a CAMIL model. Using the TFI algorithm, we learned interactions for six treatments from the LSDS-5YDM dataset. We created a CAMIL model using these interactions, resulting in a DPAC which recommends treatments towards preventing 5-year breast cancer metastasis. RESULTS: In a 5-fold cross-validation analysis, we compared the probability of being metastasis free in 5 years for patients who made decisions recommended by DPAC to those who did not. These probabilities are (the probability for those making the decisions appears first): chemotherapy (.938, .872); breast/chest wall radiation (.939, .902); nodal field radiation (.940, .784); antihormone (.941, .906); HER2 inhibitors (.934, .880); neadjuvant therapy (.931, .837). In an application of DPAC to the independent METABRIC dataset, the probabilities for chemotherapy were (.845, .788). DISCUSSION: Patients who took the advice of DPAC had, as a group, notably better outcomes than those who did not. We conclude that DPAC is effective at amassing and analyzing data towards treatment recommendations. Some of the findings in DPAC are controversial. For example, DPAC says that chemotherapy increases the chances of metastasis for many node negative patients. This controversy shows the importance of developing a conclusive version of DPAC to ensure we provide patients with the best patient-specific treatment recommendations.";1
Multi-Institutional Validation of a Knowledge-Based Planning Model for Patients Enrolled in RTOG 0617: Implications for Plan Quality Controls in Cooperative Group Trials.;"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using a single-institution, knowledge-based planning (KBP) model as a dosimetric plan quality control (QC) for multi-institutional clinical trials. The efficacy of this QC tool was retrospectively evaluated using a subset of plans submitted to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) study 0617. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A single KBP model was created using commercially available software (RapidPlan; Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) and data from 106 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who were treated at a single institution. All plans had prescriptions that ranged from 60 Gy in 30 fractions to 74 Gy in 37 fractions and followed the planning guidelines from RTOG 0617. Two sets of optimization objectives were created to produce different trade-offs using the single KBP model predictions: one prioritizing target coverage and a second prioritizing lung sparing (LS) while allowing an acceptable variation in target coverage. Three institutions submitted a high volume of clinical plans to RTOG 0617 and provided data on 25 patients, which were replanned using both sets of optimization objectives. Model-generated, dose-volume histogram predictions were used to identify patients who exceeded the lung clinical target volume (CTV) V(20Gy) >37% and would benefit from the LS objectives. Overall plan quality differences between KBP-generated plans and clinical plans were evaluated at RTOG 0617-defined dosimetric endpoints. RESULTS: Target coverage and organ at risk sparing was significantly improved for most KBP-generated plans compared with those from clinical trial data. The KBP model using prioritized target coverage objectives reduced heart D(mean) and V(40Gy) by 2.1 Gy and 5.2%, respectively. Similarly, using LS objectives reduced the lung CTV D(mean) and V(20Gy) by 2.0 Gy and 2.9%, respectively. The KBP predictions correctly identified all patients with lung CTV V20Gy > 37% (5 of 25 patients) and significantly reduced the dose to the lung CTV by applying the LS optimization objectives. CONCLUSIONS: A single-institution KBP model can be applied as a QC tool for multi-institutional clinical trials to improve overall plan quality and provide decision-support to determine the need for anatomy-based dosimetric trade-offs.";1
A Quantitative Clinical Decision-Support Strategy Identifying Which Patients With Oropharyngeal Head and Neck Cancer May Benefit the Most From Proton Radiation Therapy.;"PURPOSE: Developing a quantitative decision-support strategy estimating the impact of normal tissue complications from definitive radiation therapy (RT) for head and neck cancer (HNC). We developed this strategy to identify patients with oropharyngeal HNC who may benefit most from receiving proton RT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Recent normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models for dysphagia, esophagitis, hypothyroidism, xerostomia, and oral mucositis were used to estimate NTCP for 33 patients with oropharyngeal HNC previously treated with photon intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Comparative proton therapy plans were generated using clinical protocols for HNC RT at a collaborating proton center. Organ-at-risk (OAR) doses from photon and proton RT plans were used to calculate NTCPs; Monte Carlo sampling 10,000 times was used for each patient to account for model parameter uncertainty. The latency and duration of each complication were modeled from calculated NTCP, accounting for age-, sex-, smoking- and p16-specific conditional survival probability. Complications were then assigned quality-adjustment factors based on severity to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost from each complication. RESULTS: Based on our institutional-delivered photon IMRT doses and the achievable proton therapy doses, the average QALY reduction from all HNC RT complications for photon and proton therapy was 1.52 QALYs versus 1.15 QALYs, with proton therapy sparing 0.37 QALYs on average (composite 95% confidence interval, 0.27-2.53 QALYs). Long-term complications (dysphagia and xerostomia) contributed most to the QALY reduction. The QALYs spared with proton RT varied considerably among patients, ranging from 0.06 to 0.84 QALYs. Younger patients with p16-positive tumors who smoked </=10 pack-years may benefit most from proton therapy, although this finding should be validated using larger patient series. A sensitivity analysis reducing photon IMRT doses to all OARs by 20% resulted in no overall estimated benefit with proton therapy with -0.02 QALYs spared, although some patients still had an estimated benefit in this scenario, ranging from -0.50 to 0.43 QALYs spared. CONCLUSIONS: This quantitative decision-support strategy allowed us to identify patients with oropharyngeal cancer who might benefit the most from proton RT, although the estimated benefit of proton therapy ultimately depends on the OAR doses achievable with modern photon IMRT solutions. These results can help radiation oncologists and proton therapy centers optimize resource allocation and improve quality of life for patients with HNC.";1
Development and validation of a decision support tool to select IMRT as radiotherapy treatment planning modality for patients with locoregionally advanced non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).;OBJECTIVE: Radiation planning for locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be time-consuming and iterative. Many cases cannot be planned satisfactorily using multisegment three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). We sought to develop and validate a predictive model which could estimate the probability that acceptable target volume coverage would need intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). METHODS: Variables related to the planning target volume (PTV) and topography were identified heuristically. These included the PTV, it's craniocaudal extent, the ratio of PTV to total lung volume, distance of the centroid of the PTV from the spinal canal, and the extent PTV crossed the midline. Metrics were chosen such that they could be measured objectively, quickly and reproducibly. A logistic regression model was trained and validated on 202 patients with NSCLC. A group of patients who had both complex 3DCRT and IMRT planned was then used to derive the utility of the use of such a model in the clinic based on the time taken for planning such complex 3DCRT. RESULTS: Of the 202 patients, 93 received IMRT, as they had larger volumes crossing midline. The final model showed a good rank discrimination (Harrell's C-index 0.84) and low calibration error (mean absolute error of 0.014). Predictive accuracy in an external dataset was 92%. The final model was presented as a nomogram. Using this model, the dosimetrist can save a median planning time of 168 min per case. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a data-driven, decision aid which can reproducibly determine the best planning technique for locally-advanced NSCLC. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Our validated, data-driven decision aid can help the planner to determine the need for IMRT in locally advanced NSCLC saving significant planning time in the process.;1
Model-Supported Radiotherapy Personalization: In silico Test of Hyper- and Hypo-Fractionation Effects.;The need for radiotherapy personalization is now widely recognized, however, it would require considerations not only on the probability of control and survival of the tumor, but also on the possible toxic effects, on the quality of the expected life and the economic efficiency of the treatment. In this paper, we propose a simulation tool that can be integrated into a decision support system that allows selection of the most suitable irradiation regimen. We used a macroscale mathematical model, which includes active and necrotic tumor dynamics and the role of oxygenation to simulate the effects of different hypo-/hyper-fractional regimens using retrospective data of seven virtual patients from as many cervical cancer patients used for its training in a previous study. The results confirmed the heterogeneous response across the patients as a function of treatment regimen and suggested the tumor growth rate as a main factor in the final tumor regression. In addition to the maximum regression, another criterion was suggested to select the most suitable regimen (minimum number of fractions to achieve a regression of 80%) minimizing the toxicity and maximizing the cost-effectiveness ratio. Despite the lack of direct validation, the simulation results are in agreement with the literature findings that suggest the need for hypo-fractionated regimens in case of aggressive tumor phenotypes. Finally, the paper suggests a possible exploitation of the model within a tool to support clinical decisions.;1
An image-guided radiotherapy decision support framework incorporating a Bayesian network and visualization tool.;PURPOSE: To describe a Bayesian network (BN) and complementary visualization tool that aim to support decision-making during online cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-based image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) for prostate cancer patients. METHODS: The BN was created to represent relationships between observed prostate, proximal seminal vesicle (PSV), bladder and rectum volume variations, an image feature alignment score (FAS(TV)(_)(OAR) ), delivered dose, and treatment plan compliance (TPC). Variables influencing tumor volume (TV) targeting accuracy such as intrafraction motion, and contouring and couch shift errors were also represented. A score of overall TPC (FAS(global) ) and factors such as image quality were used to inform the BN output node providing advice about proceeding with treatment. The BN was quantified using conditional probabilities generated from published studies, FAS(TV)(_)(OAR)(/global) modeling, and a survey of IGRT decision-making practices. A new IGRT visualization tool (IGRT(REV) ), in the form of Mollweide projection plots, was developed to provide a global summary of residual errors after online CBCT-planning CT registration. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were undertaken to evaluate the performance of the BN and the relative influence of the network variables on TPC and the decision to proceed with treatment. The IGRT(REV) plots were evaluated in conjunction with the BN scenario testing, using additional test data generated from retrospective CBCT-planning CT soft-tissue registrations for 13/36 patients whose data were used in the FAS(TV)(_)(OAR)(/global) modeling. RESULTS: Modeling of the TV targeting errors resulted in a very low probability of corrected distances between the CBCT and planning CT prostate or PSV volumes being within their thresholds. Strength of influence evaluation with and without the BN TV targeting error nodes indicated that rectum- and bladder-related network variables had the highest relative importance. When the TV targeting error nodes were excluded from the BN, TPC was sensitive to observed PSV and rectum variations while the decision to treat was sensitive to observed prostate and PSV variations. When root nodes were set so the PSV and rectum variations exceeded thresholds, the probability of low TPC increased to 40%. Prostate and PSV variations exceeding thresholds increased the likelihood of repositioning or repeating patient preparation to 43%. Scenario testing using the test data from 13 patients, demonstrated two cases where the BN provided increased high TPC probabilities, despite some of the prostate and PSV volume variation metrics not being within tolerance. The IGRT(REV) tool was effective in highlighting and quantifying where TV and OAR variations occurred, supporting the BN recommendation to reposition the patient or repeat their bladder and bowel preparation. In another case, the IGRT(REV) tool was also effective in highlighting where PSV volume variation significantly exceeded tolerance when the BN had indicated to proceed with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that both the BN and IGRT(REV) plots are effective tools for inclusion in a decision support system for online CBCT-based IGRT for prostate cancer patients. Alternate approaches to modeling TV targeting errors need to be explored as well as extension of the BN to support offline IGRT decisions related to adaptive radiotherapy.;1
Towards a Clinical Decision Support System for External Beam Radiation Oncology Prostate Cancer Patients: Proton vs. Photon Radiotherapy? A Radiobiological Study of Robustness and Stability.;"We present a methodology which can be utilized to select proton or photon radiotherapy in prostate cancer patients. Four state-of-the-art competing treatment modalities were compared (by way of an in silico trial) for a cohort of 25 prostate cancer patients, with and without correction strategies for prostate displacements. Metrics measured from clinical image guidance systems were used. Three correction strategies were investigated; no-correction, extended-no-action-limit, and online-correction. Clinical efficacy was estimated via radiobiological models incorporating robustness (how probable a given treatment plan was delivered) and stability (the consistency between the probable best and worst delivered treatments at the 95% confidence limit). The results obtained at the cohort level enabled the determination of a threshold for likely clinical benefit at the individual level. Depending on the imaging system and correction strategy; 24%, 32% and 44% of patients were identified as suitable candidates for proton therapy. For the constraints of this study: Intensity-modulated proton therapy with online-correction was on average the most effective modality. Irrespective of the imaging system, each treatment modality is similar in terms of robustness, with and without the correction strategies. Conversely, there is substantial variation in stability between the treatment modalities, which is greatly reduced by correction strategies. This study provides a 'proof-of-concept' methodology to enable the prospective identification of individual patients that will most likely (above a certain threshold) benefit from proton therapy.";1
Clinical decision support of radiotherapy treatment planning: A data-driven machine learning strategy for patient-specific dosimetric decision making.;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinical decision support systems are a growing class of tools with the potential to impact healthcare. This study investigates the construction of a decision support system through which clinicians can efficiently identify which previously approved historical treatment plans are achievable for a new patient to aid in selection of therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Treatment data were collected for early-stage lung and postoperative oropharyngeal cancers treated using photon (lung and head and neck) and proton (head and neck) radiotherapy. Machine-learning classifiers were constructed using patient-specific feature-sets and a library of historical plans. Model accuracy was analyzed using learning curves, and historical treatment plan matching was investigated. RESULTS: Learning curves demonstrate that for these datasets, approximately 45, 60, and 30 patients are needed for a sufficiently accurate classification model for radiotherapy for early-stage lung, postoperative oropharyngeal photon, and postoperative oropharyngeal proton, respectively. The resulting classification model provides a database of previously approved treatment plans that are achievable for a new patient. An exemplary case, highlighting tradeoffs between the heart and chest wall dose while holding target dose constant in two historical plans is provided. CONCLUSIONS: We report on the first artificial-intelligence based clinical decision support system that connects patients to past discrete treatment plans in radiation oncology and demonstrate for the first time how this tool can enable clinicians to use past decisions to help inform current assessments. Clinicians can be informed of dose tradeoffs between critical structures early in the treatment process, enabling more time spent on finding the optimal course of treatment for individual patients.;1
Development of an evidence-based decision pathway for vestibular schwannoma treatment options.;OBJECTIVE: To integrate multiple sources of clinical information with patient feedback to build evidence-based decision support model to facilitate treatment selection for patients suffering from vestibular schwannomas (VS). METHODS: This was a mixed methods study utilizing focus group and survey methodology to solicit feedback on factors important for making treatment decisions among patients. Two 90-minute focus groups were conducted by an experienced facilitator. Previously diagnosed VS patients were recruited by clinical investigators at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). Classical content analysis was used for focus group data analysis. Providers were recruited from practices within the UPMC system and were surveyed using Delphi methods. This information can provide a basis for multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework to develop a treatment decision support system for patients with VS. RESULTS: Eight themes were derived from these data (focus group + surveys): doctor/health care system, side effects, effectiveness of treatment, anxiety, mortality, family/other people, quality of life, and post-operative symptoms. These data, as well as feedback from physicians were utilized in building a multi-criteria decision model. DISCUSSION: The study illustrated steps involved in the development of a decision support model that integrates evidence-based data and patient values to select treatment alternatives. CONCLUSIONS: Studies focusing on the actual development of the decision support technology for this group of patients are needed, as decisions are highly multifactorial. Such tools have the potential to improve decision making for complex medical problems with alternate treatment pathways.;1
SPIDERplan: A tool to support decision-making in radiation therapy treatment plan assessment.;AIM: In this work, a graphical method for radiotherapy treatment plan assessment and comparison, named SPIDERplan, is proposed. It aims to support plan approval allowing independent and consistent comparisons of different treatment techniques, algorithms or treatment planning systems. BACKGROUND: Optimized plans from modern radiotherapy are not easy to evaluate and compare because of their inherent multicriterial nature. The clinical decision on the best treatment plan is mostly based on subjective options. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SPIDERplan combines a graphical analysis with a scoring index. Customized radar plots based on the categorization of structures into groups and on the determination of individual structures scores are generated. To each group and structure, an angular amplitude is assigned expressing the clinical importance defined by the radiation oncologist. Completing the graphical evaluation, a global plan score, based on the structures score and their clinical weights, is determined. After a necessary clinical validation of the group weights, SPIDERplan efficacy, to compare and rank different plans, was tested through a planning exercise where plans had been generated for a nasal cavity case using different treatment planning systems. RESULTS: SPIDERplan method was applied to the dose metrics achieved by the nasal cavity test plans. The generated diagrams and scores successfully ranked the plans according to the prescribed dose objectives and constraints and the radiation oncologist priorities, after a necessary clinical validation process. CONCLUSIONS: SPIDERplan enables a fast and consistent evaluation of plan quality considering all targets and organs at risk.;1
Knowledge-driven decision support for assessing dose distributions in radiation therapy of head and neck cancer.;PURPOSE: Clinical data that are generated through routine radiation therapy procedures can be leveraged as a source of knowledge to provide evidence-based decision support for future patients. Treatment planning in radiation therapy often relies on trial-and-error iterations, experience, judgment calls and general guidelines. The authors present a knowledge-driven decision support system that assists clinicians by reducing some of the uncertainties associated with treatment planning and provides quantified empirical estimates to help minimize the radiation dose to healthy critical structures surrounding the tumor. METHODS: A database of retrospective DICOM RT data fuels a decision support engine, which assists clinicians in selecting dose constraints and assessing dose distributions. The first step is to quantify the spatial relationships between the tumor and surrounding critical structures through features that account for distance, volume, overlap, location, shape and orientation. These features are used to identify database cases that are anatomically similar to the new patient. The dose profiles of these database cases can help clinicians to estimate an acceptable dose distribution for the new case, based on empirical evidence. Since database diversity is essential for good system performance, an infrastructure for multi-institutional collaboration was also conceptualized in order to pave the way for data sharing of protected health information. RESULTS: A set of 127 retrospective test cases was collected from a single institution in order to conduct a leave-one-out evaluation of the decision support module. In 72 % of these retrospective test cases, patients with similar tumor anatomy were also found to exhibit similar radiation dose distributions. This demonstrates the system's ability to successfully extract retrospective database cases that can estimate the new patient's dose distribution. CONCLUSION: The radiation therapy treatment planning decision support system presented here can assist clinicians in determining good dose constraints and assessing dose distributions by using knowledge gained from retrospective treatment plans.;1
Development and evaluation of an online three-level proton vs photon decision support prototype for head and neck cancer - Comparison of dose, toxicity and cost-effectiveness.;To quantitatively assess the effectiveness of proton therapy for individual patients, we developed a prototype for an online platform for proton decision support (PRODECIS) comparing photon and proton treatments on dose metric, toxicity and cost-effectiveness levels. An evaluation was performed with 23 head and neck cancer datasets.;1
A dose-volume histogram based decision-support system for dosimetric comparison of radiotherapy treatment plans.;BACKGROUND: The choice of any radiotherapy treatment plan is usually made after the evaluation of a few preliminary isodose distributions obtained from different beam configurations. Despite considerable advances in planning techniques, such final decision remains a challenging task that would greatly benefit from efficient and reliable assessment tools. METHODS: For any dosimetric plan considered, data on dose-volume histograms supplied by treatment planning systems are used to provide estimates on planning target coverage as well as on sparing of organs at risk and the remaining healthy tissue. These partial metrics are then combined into a dose distribution index (DDI), which provides a unified, easy-to-read score for each competing radiotherapy plan. To assess the performance of the proposed scoring system, DDI figures for fifty brain cancer patients were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were divided in three groups depending on tumor location and malignancy. For each patient, three tentative plans were designed and recorded during planning, one of which was eventually selected for treatment. We thus were able to compare the plans with better DDI scores and those actually delivered. RESULTS: When planning target coverage and organs at risk sparing are considered as equally important, the tentative plan with the highest DDI score is shown to coincide with that actually delivered in 32 of the 50 patients considered. In 15 (respectively 3) of the remaining 18 cases, the plan with highest DDI value still coincides with that actually selected, provided that organs at risk sparing is given higher priority (respectively, lower priority) than target coverage. CONCLUSIONS: DDI provides a straightforward and non-subjective tool for dosimetric comparison of tentative radiotherapy plans. In particular, DDI readily quantifies differences among competing plans with similar-looking dose-volume histograms and can be easily implemented for any tumor type and localization, irrespective of the planning system and irradiation technique considered. Moreover, DDI permits to estimate the dosimetry impact of different priorities being assigned to sparing of organs at risk or to better target coverage.;1
Implementation of a software for REmote COMparison of PARticlE and photon treatment plans: ReCompare.;PURPOSE: To guarantee equal access to optimal radiotherapy, a concept of patient assignment to photon or particle radiotherapy using remote treatment plan exchange and comparison - ReCompare - was proposed. We demonstrate the implementation of this concept and present its clinical applicability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ReCompare concept was implemented using a client-server based software solution. A clinical workflow for the remote treatment plan exchange and comparison was defined. The steps required by the user and performed by the software for a complete plan transfer were described and an additional module for dose-response modeling was added. RESULTS: The ReCompare software was successfully tested in cooperation with three external partner clinics and worked meeting all required specifications. It was compatible with several standard treatment planning systems, ensured patient data protection, and integrated in the clinical workflow. CONCLUSION: The ReCompare software can be applied to support non-particle radiotherapy institutions with the patient-specific treatment decision on the optimal irradiation modality by remote treatment plan exchange and comparison.;1
Rapid learning in practice: a lung cancer survival decision support system in routine patient care data.;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A rapid learning approach has been proposed to extract and apply knowledge from routine care data rather than solely relying on clinical trial evidence. To validate this in practice we deployed a previously developed decision support system (DSS) in a typical, busy clinic for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gender, age, performance status, lung function, lymph node status, tumor volume and survival were extracted without review from clinical data sources for lung cancer patients. With these data the DSS was tested to predict overall survival. RESULTS: 3919 lung cancer patients were identified with 159 eligible for inclusion, due to ineligible histology or stage, non-radical dose, missing tumor volume or survival. The DSS successfully identified a good prognosis group and a medium/poor prognosis group (2 year OS 69% vs. 27/30%, p<0.001). Stage was less discriminatory (2 year OS 47% for stage I-II vs. 36% for stage IIIA-IIIB, p=0.12) with most good prognosis patients having higher stage disease. The DSS predicted a large absolute overall survival benefit ( approximately 40%) for a radical dose compared to a non-radical dose in patients with a good prognosis, while no survival benefit of radical radiotherapy was predicted for patients with a poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid learning environment is possible with the quality of clinical data sufficient to validate a DSS. It uses patient and tumor features to identify prognostic groups in whom therapy can be individualized based on predicted outcomes. Especially the survival benefit of a radical versus non-radical dose predicted by the DSS for various prognostic groups has clinical relevance, but needs to be prospectively validated.;1
Patient clinical profiles associated with physician non-compliance despite the use of a guideline-based decision support system: a case study with OncoDoc2 using data mining techniques;OncoDoc2 is a guideline-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) applied to the management of breast cancer patients. OncoDoc2 has been routinely used during multidisciplinary staff meetings at the Tenon Hospital (Paris, France) for nearly 3 years. Despite the use of the CDSS that reminds physicians of the recommended treatments, the compliance rate of decisions is not 100%. We have used pattern mining techniques in order to elicit patient clinical profiles associated with non-compliance. We quantified each extracted pattern by three measures (support, growth rate, and unexpected rate) and we introduced a score to prune relevant emerging patterns. Non-compliance has concerned elderly patients in pre-surgery decisions, patients with micro invasive tumor in re-excision decisions, and patients HR+ and Her2+ in adjuvant decisions. In all cases, physician non-compliance with guidelines occurs when scientific evidence is lacking.;1
TU-E-BRB-02: A Decision Support Tool for SBRT Planning Using a Searchable DVH Database.;PURPOSE: Develop a decision support tool that aids dosimetrists, physicians, and physicists in assessing and improving plan quality through comparison to plans previously used in similar clinical situations. METHODS: Software was developed to capture and store DVHs and other clinically relevant treatment plan characteristics in a database. In addition to the plan DVH, the database contains a total of 24 plan characteristics including fractionation, prescribed dose, treatment volume, prior surgery, tumor position, and smoking history. DVH and other plan data was captured from the treatment planning system via exported dicom RT files. Structures in the plan were automatically matched by name to a list of standard structures using a system of regular expressions. Additional fields were entered manually using a simple java interface. As a support tool, a plan under development can be quickly compared to similar plans in the database based on selected plan characteristics. A plot displaying the current and historical DVHs provides an easy visual comparison. Our interface also provides statistics for comparison for each dose/volume level such as average, minimum, maximum and standard deviation. RESULTS: DVHs from 111 lung SBRT plans treated from 2009-2011 were imported in accordance with an approved IRB protocol. As an example of data comparisons that can be easily performed to guide plan evaluation, we examined plans prescribing 5400cGy in 3 fractions and found that tumors >7.5cc (n=34) had an average PTV coverage of 94.2% (range: 73.5-95.0%), and tumors =7.5cc (n=35) had an average PTV coverage of 94.9% (range: 81.6-99.6%). CONCLUSION: A searchable DVH database was constructed to provide planners, physicists, and physicians with a straightforward means of comparing plans against historic distributions of DVHs. In the future, outcome data will be included in the database to strengthen its functionality as a decision support and research tool.;1
Multidisciplinary pain management based on a computerized clinical decision support system in cancer pain patients.;"A prospective controlled intervention cohort study in cancer pain patients (n=50 per group) admitted to radiation oncology wards (62 beds, 3 wards) was conducted in a 1621-bed university hospital. We investigated the effect of an intervention consisting of daily pain assessment using the numeric visual analog scale (NVAS) and pain therapy counseling to clinicians based on a computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) to correct deviations from pain therapy guidelines. Effects on guideline adherence (primary outcome), pain relief (NVAS) at rest and during physical activity (both groups: cross-sectional assessment on day 5; intervention group: every day assessment), co-analgesic prescription, and acceptance rates of recommendations (secondary outcomes) were assessed. The number of patients with at least one deviation from guidelines at discharge was decreased by the intervention from 37 (74%) in controls to 7 (14%, p<0.001). In the intervention group, pain (NVAS) decreased during hospital stay at rest from 3.0 (Delta(0.5) (Q(75%)-Q(25%))=3.0) on admission to 1.5 (Delta(0.5)=1.0) at discharge (p<0.01) and during physical activity from 7.0 (Delta(0.5)=4.0) on admission to 2.5 (Delta(0.5)=3.8) at discharge (p<0.001). At discharge, the number of patients treated with co-analgesics increased from 23 (46%) in controls to 33 (66%) in the intervention group (p=0.04). From 279 recommendations issued in the intervention 85% were fully accepted by the physicians. Deviations from well-established guidelines are frequent in pain therapy. A multidisciplinary pain management increased adherence to pain management guidelines.";1
Evaluation of a decision-support system for inoperable non-small cell lung cancer.;The purpose of this study was to find out whether a decision-support system is able to assist a clinician in predicting patient outcome and in selecting optimal treatment in oncology. The domain of the evaluated decision-support prototype was primary therapeutic decision making in inoperable non-small cell lung cancer. The performance of the prototype was tested on retrospective material consisting of 112 patients treated by radiotherapy. Survival was the endpoint for examining whether the treatment decision proposed by the system was more accurate than the decision actually made by the clinician. Certain prognostic variables were used by the system to classify patients into two treatment groups, radical or palliative radiotherapy. The median survival times of these groups were 15 and 7 months, respectively, compared with 9 and 8 months in the corresponding groups classified by the clinician. Our results indicate that clinicians need support in treatment selection and that decision-support systems could be a potential answer.;1
Objective evaluation of 3-D radiation treatment plans: a decision-analytic tool incorporating treatment preferences of radiation oncologists;Purpose: Selecting the optimal radiation treatment plan from a set of competing plans involves making trade-offs among the doses delivered to the target volumes and normal tissues by the competing plans. Evaluation of 3-dimensional radiation treatment plans is difficult because it requires the review of vast amount of graphical and numerical data. We have developed an objective plan-ranking model based on the concepts of decision analysis. Methods and materials: Our model ranks a set of tentative radiation treatment plans from best to worst. A figure of merit is computed for each plan based on probabilities of possible clinical complications such as non-eradication of the tumor and radiation induced damage to the nearby healthy normal tissues, and weights which indicate their clinical relevance. This figure of merit is used to rank the plans. Key issues addressed by the model include the incorporation of individual treatment preferences of the radiation oncologist and clinical features of the patient. Results: A methodology has been established for eliciting the treatment preferences of radiation oncologists. Results of this elicitation, and examples of several plan evaluations are presented. An interactive computer-based tool has been developed as one of a set of tools to assist in the evaluation of 3-dimensional radiation treatment plans. Conclusion: The paper presents a decision-analytic model incorporating radiation oncologists' treatment preferences and an interactive computer-based tool for objectively ranking competing radiation treatment plans. The tool can be used by radiation oncologists for the evaluation of competing plans, or as part of a system which tries to automatically generate optimal treatment plans using mathematical or symbolic techniques.;1
The Burden of Uncontrolled Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Men With Prostate Cancer: A RADICAL-PC Analysis.;"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence is higher in men with prostate cancer (PC) than without. OBJECTIVES: We describe the rate and correlates of poor cardiovascular risk factor control among men with PC. METHODS: We prospectively characterized 2,811 consecutive men (mean age 68 +/- 8 years) with PC from 24 sites in Canada, Israel, Brazil, and Australia. We defined poor overall risk factor control as >/=3 of the following: suboptimal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (>2 mmol/L if Framingham Risk Score [FRS] >/=15 and >/=3.5 mmol/L if FRS <15), current smoker, physical inactivity (<600 MET min/wk), suboptimal blood pressure (BP) (>/=140/90 mm Hg if no other risk factors, systolic BP >/=120 mm Hg if known CVD or FRS >/=15, and >/=130/80 mm Hg if diabetic), and waist:hip ratio >0.9. RESULTS: Among participants (9% with metastatic PC and 23% with pre-existing CVD), 99% had >/=1 uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factor, and 51% had poor overall risk factor control. Not taking a statin (odds ratio [OR]: 2.55; 95% CI: 2.00-3.26), physical frailty (OR: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.51-3.71), need for BP drugs (OR: 2.36; 95% CI: 1.84-3.03), and age (OR per 10-year increase: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.14-1.59) were associated with poor overall risk factor control after adjustment for education, PC characteristics, androgen deprivation therapy, depression, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group functional status. CONCLUSIONS: Poor control of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors is common in men with PC, highlighting the large gap in care and the need for improved interventions to optimize cardiovascular risk management in this population.";0
Bedside exclusion of pulmonary embolism in children without radiation (BEEPER): a national study of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network-Study protocol.;BACKGROUND: The Pulmonary Embolism Rule Out Criteria (PERC) Peds rule, derived from the PERC rule, was derived to estimate a low pretest probability for pulmonary embolism (PE) in children but has not been prospectively validated. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to present a protocol for an ongoing multicenter prospective observational study that evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of the PERC-Peds rule. METHODS: This protocol is identified by the acronym, BEdside Exclusion of Pulmonary Embolism without Radiation in children. The study aims were designed to prospectively validate, or if necessary, refine, the accuracy of PERC-Peds and D-dimer in excluding PE among children with clinical suspicion or testing for PE. Multiple ancillary studies will examine clinical characteristics and epidemiology of the participants. Children aged 4 through 17 years were being enrolled at 21 sites through the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). Patients taking anticoagulant therapy are excluded. PERC-Peds criteria data, clinical gestalt, and demographic information are collected in real time. The criterion standard outcome is image-confirmed venous thromboembolism within 45 days, determined from independent expert adjudication. We assessed interrater reliability of the PERC-Peds, frequency of PERC-Peds use in routine clinical care, and descriptive characteristics of missed eligible and missed patients with PE. RESULTS: Enrollment is currently 60% complete with an anticipated data lock in 2025. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective multicenter observational study will not only test whether a set of simple criteria can safely exclude PE without need for imaging but also provide a resource to fill a critical knowledge gap about clinical characteristics of children with suspected and diagnosed PE.;0
Development and validation of nomograms to predict survival in patients with invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the breast.;OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to develop and validate nomograms to predict the survival of patients with breast invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) to aid objective decision-making. DESIGN: Prognostic factors were identified using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses and used to construct nomograms to predict overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) at 3 and 5 years. Kaplan-Meier analysis, calibration curves, the area under the curve (AUC) and the concordance index (C-index) evaluated the nomograms' performance. Decision curve analysis (DCA), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and net reclassification improvement (NRI) were used to compare the nomograms with the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. SETTING: Patient data were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. This database holds data related to the incidence of cancer acquired from 18 population-based cancer registries in the US. PARTICIPANTS: We ruled out 1893 patients and allowed the incorporation of 1340 patients into the present study. RESULTS: The C-index of the AJCC8 stage was lower than that of the OS nomogram (0.670 vs 0.766) and the OS nomograms had higher AUCs than the AJCC8 stage (3 years: 0.839 vs 0.735, 5 years: 0.787 vs 0.658). On calibration plots, the predicted and actual outcomes agreed well, and DCA revealed that the nomograms had better clinical utility compared with the conventional prognosis tool. In the training cohort, the NRI for OS was 0.227, and for BCSS was 0.182, while the IDI for OS was 0.070, and for BCSS was 0.078 (both p<0.001), confirming its accuracy. The Kaplan-Meier curves for nomogram-based risk stratification showed significant differences (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The nomograms showed excellent discrimination and clinical utility to predict OS and BCSS at 3 and 5 years, and could identify high-risk patients, thus providing IMPC patients with personalised treatment strategies.;0
The underused potential of breast conserving therapy after neoadjuvant system treatment - Causes and solutions.;Breast conserving therapy (BCT), consisting of breast conserving surgery and subsequent radiotherapy, is an equivalent option to mastectomy for women with early breast cancer. Although BCT after neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NAST) has been routinely recommend by international guidelines since many years, the rate of BCT worldwide varies largely and its potential is still underused. While the rate of BCT in western countries has increased over the past decades to currently about 70%, the rate of BCT is as low as 10% in other countries. In this review, we will evaluate the underused potential of breast conservation after NAST, identify causes, and discuss possible solutions. We identified clinical and non-clinical causes for the underuse of BCT after NAST including uncertainties within the community regarding oncologic outcomes, the correct tumor localization after NAST, the management of multifocal and multicentric tumors, margin assessment, disparities of socio-economic aspects on a patient and national level, and psychological biases affecting the shared decision-making process between patients and clinicians. Possible solutions to mitigate the underuse of BCT after NAST include interdisciplinary teams that keep the whole patient pathway in mind, optimized treatment counseling and shared decision-making, and targeted financial support to alleviate disparities.;0
Improving patient-centered communication in breast cancer: a study protocol for a multilevel intervention of a shared treatment deliberation system (SharES) within the NCI community oncology research program (NCORP) (Alliance A231901CD).;BACKGROUND: Advances in precision medicine have given oncologists new evaluative tools to better individualize treatments for patients with curable breast cancer. These innovations have revealed a need to improve patient understanding of novel, often complex information related to breast cancer treatment decisions. Ensuring patients have the emotional support to face consequential treatment decisions, as well as the opportunity to engage and discuss with their clinicians, is key to improving patient-centered communication and patient understanding. METHODS/DESIGN: This study will implement a multilevel intervention with patient and clinician components as a NCORP Cancer Care Delivery Research (CCDR) trial within the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Research Base (Alliance). The two interventions in this study, the Shared Decision Engagement System (SharES), include (1) two versions of an evidence-based patient-facing breast cancer treatment decision tool (iCanDecide +/- an emotional support module) and (2) a clinician-facing dashboard (Clinician Dashboard) that is reviewed by surgeons/clinicians and summarizes ongoing patient needs. The design is a near minimax, hybrid stepped wedge trial of SharES where both interventions are being evaluated in a crossed design over six 12-week time periods. The primary outcome (knowledge) and key secondary outcomes (i.e., self-efficacy and cancer worry) are assessed via patient report at 5 weeks after surgery. Secondary outcomes are also assessed at 5 weeks after surgery, as well as in a second survey 9 months after registration. We anticipate recruiting a total of 700 breast cancer patients (600 evaluable after attrition) from 25 surgical practices affiliated with Alliance. DISCUSSION: Upon study completion, we will have better understanding of the impact of a multilevel intervention on patient-centered communication in breast cancer with a specific focus on whether the intervention components improve knowledge and self-efficacy and reduce cancer worry.

The relationship of the clinicopathological characteristics and treatment results of post-Chornobyl papillary thyroid microcarcinomas with the latency period and radiation exposure.;INTRODUCTION: A worldwide increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer during the last decades is largely due to papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (MPTCs), which are mostly low-risk tumors. In view of recent clinical recommendations to reduce the extent of surgery for low-risk thyroid cancer, and persisting uncertainty about the impact of radiation history, we set out to address whether clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of post-Chornobyl MPTCs were changing with regard to: i) the latency period, ii) probability of causation (POC) of a tumor due to radiation, and iii) tumor size. METHODS: Patients (n = 465) aged up to 50 years at diagnosis who lived in April, 1986 in six northern, most radiocontaminated regions of Ukraine were studied. RESULTS: Latency period was statistically significantly associated with the reduction of POC level, tumor size and the frequency of fully encapsulated MPTCs. In contrast, the frequency of oncocytic changes and the BRAF(V600E) mutation increased. Invasive properties and clinical follow-up results did not depend on latency except for a lower frequency of complete remission after postsurgical radioiodine therapy. The POC level was associated with more frequent extrathyroidal extension, and lymphatic/vascular invasion, less frequent oncocytic changes and BRAF(V600E) , and did not associate with any clinical indicator. Tumor size was negatively associated with the latency period and BRAF(V600E) , and had a statistically significant effect on invasive properties of MPTCs: both the integrative invasiveness score and its components such as lymphatic/vascular invasion, extrathyroidal extension and lymph node metastases increased. The frequency of total thyroidectomy, neck lymph node dissection and radioiodine therapy also increased with the larger tumor size. The duration of the latency period, POC level or tumor size did not associate with the chance of disease recurrence. DISCUSSION: In summary, we did not observe overall worsening of the clinicopathological features or treatment results of radiogenic MPTCs that could be associated with the latency period or POC level, suggesting that radiation history did not strongly affect those in the analyzed MPTC patients. However, the increase in the invasive properties with tumor size indicates the need for individual risk stratification for each MPTC patient, regardless of radiation history, for treatment decision-making.;0
Multi-institution analysis of tumor mutational burden and outcomes in pediatric central nervous system tumor patients.;BACKGROUND: Pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the leading cause of pediatric cancer mortality. Research addressing genomic biomarkers and clinical outcomes is needed to inform therapeutic decision-making. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of pediatric patients (age <21) diagnosed with a primary CNS tumor at four upstate New York hospitals from 2008 to 2021. Clinical and histopathologic data were identified from each patient, including genomic analysis of somatic mutations and tumor mutational burden (TMB) where available. These variables were each compared with overall survival using Cox regression analyses. Multivariable analysis was conducted to identify patient characteristics that may independently predict survival. RESULTS: We identified 119 patients. Common tumor types included low-grade glioma (N = 51), high-grade glioma (N = 29), and medulloblastoma (N = 11). Common driver mutations included TP53 inactivation (N = 16), BRAF-KIAA1549 fusion (N = 16), FGFR1 amplification (N = 12), BRAF V600E mutation (N = 12), NF1 loss (N = 12), and H3F3A K28M mutation (N = 6). Median TMB was one mutation/megabase (mut/Mb, range = 0-132). Overall survival was 79.9%. Variables associated with poorer survival on univariable analysis were higher TMB (p = .002, HR 4.97), high-grade tumors (p = .009, HR 84.3), and high-grade glioma histology (p = .021, HR 3.14). Multivariable analyses further identified TMB (p = .011, HR 4.46) and high-grade histology (p = .015, HR 5.28) as independently predictive of worse survival. Tumor progression was more common in high-TMB (N = 15, 44%) than in low-TMB tumors (N = 19, 35%). CONCLUSIONS: High TMB is correlated with higher rates of progression and death as compared to low-TMB tumors. These findings may help identify patients who may benefit from alternative treatments, such as immunotherapies.;0
Management and Prognosis of Cardiac Metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma: A Case-Control Study and Literature Review.;"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), an aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer, has a high rate (20%) of distant metastasis. Within a prospective registry of 582 patients with metastatic MCC (mMCC) diagnosed between 2003-2021, we identified 9 (1.5%) patients who developed cardiac metastatic MCC (mMCC). We compared overall survival (OS) between patients with cardiac and non-cardiac metastases in a matched case-control study. Cardiac metastasis was a late event (median 925 days from initial MCC diagnosis). The right heart was predominantly involved (8 of 9; 89%). Among 7 patients treated with immunotherapy, 6 achieved a complete or partial response of the cardiac lesion. Among these 6 responders, 5 received concurrent cardiac radiotherapy (median 20 Gray) with immunotherapy; 4 of 5 did not have local disease progression or recurrence in the treated cardiac lesion. One-year OS was 44%, which was not significantly different from non-cardiac mMCC patients (45%, p = 0.96). Though it occurs relatively late in the disease course, cardiac mMCC responded to immunotherapy and/or radiotherapy and was not associated with worse prognosis compared to mMCC at other anatomic sites. These results are timely as cardiac mMCC may be increasingly encountered in the era of immunotherapy as patients with metastatic MCC live longer.";0
Correlation between PD-L1 Expression of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Data from IVIM-DWI Acquired during Magnetic Resonance of the Thorax: Preliminary Results.;This study aims to investigate the correlation between intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) parameters in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Twenty-one patients diagnosed with stage III NSCLC from April 2021 to April 2022 were included. The tumors were distinguished into two groups: no PD-L1 expression (<1%), and positive PD-L1 expression (>/=1%). Conventional MRI and IVIM-DWI sequences were acquired with a 1.5-T system. Both fixed-size ROIs and freehand segmentations of the tumors were evaluated, and the data were analyzed through a software using four different algorithms. The diffusion (D), pseudodiffusion (D*), and perfusion fraction (pf) were obtained. The correlation between IVIM parameters and PD-L1 expression was studied with Pearson correlation coefficient. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to study IVIM parameter distributions in the two groups. Twelve patients (57%) had PD-L1 >/=1%, and 9 (43%) <1%. There was a statistically significant correlation between D* values and PD-L1 expression in images analyzed with algorithm 0, for fixed-size ROIs (189.2 +/- 65.709 microm(2)/s x 104 in no PD-L1 expression vs. 122.0 +/- 31.306 microm(2)/s x 104 in positive PD-L1 expression, p = 0.008). The values obtained with algorithms 1, 2, and 3 were not significantly different between the groups. The IVIM-DWI MRI parameter D* can reflect PD-L1 expression in NSCLC.;0
Low-Value Prostate-Specific Antigen Test for Prostate Cancer Screening and Subsequent Health Care Utilization and Spending.;IMPORTANCE: Delivering low-value care can lead to unnecessary follow-up services and associated costs, and such care cascades have not been well examined in common clinical scenarios. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utilization and costs of care cascades of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests for prostate cancer screening, as the routine use of which among asymptomatic men aged 70 years and older is discouraged by multiple guidelines. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study included men aged 70 years and older without preexisting prostate conditions enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan during January 2016 to December 2018 with at least 1 outpatient visit. Medical billing claims data from the deidentified OptumLabs Data Warehouse were used. Data analysis was conducted from September 2020 to August 2021. EXPOSURES: At least 1 claim for low-value PSA tests for prostate cancer screening during the observation period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Utilization of and spending on low-value PSA cancer screening and associated care cascades and the difference in overall health care utilization and spending among individuals receiving low-value PSA cancer screening vs those who did not, adjusting for observed characteristics using inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: Of 995442 men (mean [SD] age, 78.0 [5.6] years) aged 70 years or older in a Medicare Advantage plan included in this study, 384058 (38.6%) received a low-value PSA cancer screening. Utilization increased for each subsequent cohort from 2016 to 2018 (49802 of 168951 [29.4%] to 134404 of 349228 [38.5%] to 199852 of 477203 [41.9%]). Among those receiving initial low-value PSA cancer screening, 241188 of 384058 (62.8%) received at least 1 follow-up service. Repeated PSA testing was the most common, and 27268 (7.1%) incurred high-cost follow-up services, such as imaging, radiation therapy, and prostatectomy. Utilization and spending associated with care cascades also increased from 2016 to 2018. For every $1 spent on a low-value PSA cancer screening, an additional $6 was spent on care cascades. Despite avoidable care cascades, individuals who received low-value PSA cancer screening were not associated with increased overall health care utilization and spending during the 1-year follow-up period compared with an unscreened population. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, low-value PSA tests for prostate cancer screening remained prevalent among Medicare Advantage plan enrollees and were associated with unnecessary expenditures due to avoidable care cascades. Innovative efforts from clinicians and policy makers, such as payment reforms, to reduce initial low-value care and avoidable care cascades are warranted to decrease harm, enhance equity, and improve health care efficiency.;0
Addressing Challenges and Controversies in the Management of Prostate Cancer with Multidisciplinary Teams.;The diagnostic and treatment landscapes of prostate cancer are rapidly evolving. This has led to several challenges and controversies regarding optimal management of the disease that outpace guidelines and clinical data. Multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) can be used to engage the array of specialists that collaborate to treat complex malignancies such as prostate cancer. While the rationale for the use of MDTs in prostate cancer is well known, ways to optimally use MDTs to address the challenges and controversies associated with prostate cancer management are less well understood. One area of MDT care that remains undefined is how MDTs can most effectively provide guidance on clinical decision-making in situations in which information from novel diagnostic testing (genetic testing, molecular imaging) is substantially different from the established clinical risk factors. In this review, we provide a clinical perspective on ways that MDTs can be used to address this and other challenges and controversies across the prostate cancer disease continuum, from diagnosis to end-of-life considerations. Beyond clinical scenarios, we also review ways in which MDTs can mitigate disparities of care in prostate cancer. Overall, MDTs play a central role in helping to address the daily vexing issues faced by clinicians related to diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment. Given the accelerating advances in precision medicine and targeted therapy, and the new questions and controversies these will bring, the value of MDTs for prostate cancer management will only increase in the future.;0
Effect of (131)I with and without artificial liver support system in patients with Graves' disease and severe liver dysfunction: A retrospective study.;"OBJECTIVE: Treatment decision-making in Graves' disease (GD) with severe liver dysfunction (LD) is a clinical challenge. This research was carried out to evaluate the effect of radioiodine ((131)I) with or without an artificial liver support system (ALSS) in GD patients with severe LD. METHODS: In total, 45 patients diagnosed with GD and severe LD were enrolled and allocated to two groups: patients treated with (131)I alone (n=30) (Group A)and patients by a combination of (131)I and ALSS (n=15)(Group B). Liver function, thyroid hormone concentrations, therapeutic efficacy, and the cost of treatment were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Thyroid hormone concentrations were lower 2 weeks after (131)I treatment, but no deterioration in liver function was identified. There was no statistically significant difference in the treatment efficacy between the two groups. The hospital stay, total cost, and daily cost were lower in patients treated with (131)I alone than in those treated with (131)I and an ALSS (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The key point of treating GD patients with severe LD is to control the GD.(131)I is recommended as an effective and safe and should be applied as soon as possible once the diagnosis is clarified; however, when used in combination with an ALSS, there was no substantial improvement in therapeutic efficacy.";0
A path to translation: How 3D patient tumor avatars enable next generation precision oncology.;3D patient tumor avatars (3D-PTAs) hold promise for next-generation precision medicine. Here, we describe the benefits and challenges of 3D-PTA technologies and necessary future steps to realize their potential for clinical decision making. 3D-PTAs require standardization criteria and prospective trials to establish clinical benefits. Innovative trial designs that combine omics and 3D-PTA readouts may lead to more accurate clinical predictors, and an integrated platform that combines diagnostic and therapeutic development will accelerate new treatments for patients with refractory disease.;0
Global Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Stroke Volumes and Cerebrovascular Events: A 1-Year Follow-up.;"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Declines in stroke admission, IV thrombolysis (IVT), and mechanical thrombectomy volumes were reported during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a paucity of data on the longer-term effect of the pandemic on stroke volumes over the course of a year and through the second wave of the pandemic. We sought to measure the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the volumes of stroke admissions, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), IVT, and mechanical thrombectomy over a 1-year period at the onset of the pandemic (March 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021) compared with the immediately preceding year (March 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020). METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal retrospective study across 6 continents, 56 countries, and 275 stroke centers. We collected volume data for COVID-19 admissions and 4 stroke metrics: ischemic stroke admissions, ICH admissions, IVT treatments, and mechanical thrombectomy procedures. Diagnoses were identified by their ICD-10 codes or classifications in stroke databases. RESULTS: There were 148,895 stroke admissions in the 1 year immediately before compared with 138,453 admissions during the 1-year pandemic, representing a 7% decline (95% CI [95% CI 7.1-6.9]; p < 0.0001). ICH volumes declined from 29,585 to 28,156 (4.8% [5.1-4.6]; p < 0.0001) and IVT volume from 24,584 to 23,077 (6.1% [6.4-5.8]; p < 0.0001). Larger declines were observed at high-volume compared with low-volume centers (all p < 0.0001). There was no significant change in mechanical thrombectomy volumes (0.7% [0.6-0.9]; p = 0.49). Stroke was diagnosed in 1.3% [1.31-1.38] of 406,792 COVID-19 hospitalizations. SARS-CoV-2 infection was present in 2.9% ([2.82-2.97], 5,656/195,539) of all stroke hospitalizations. DISCUSSION: There was a global decline and shift to lower-volume centers of stroke admission volumes, ICH volumes, and IVT volumes during the 1st year of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the prior year. Mechanical thrombectomy volumes were preserved. These results suggest preservation in the stroke care of higher severity of disease through the first pandemic year.

The Association Between Financial Toxicity and Treatment Regret in Men With Localized Prostate Cancer.;"BACKGROUND: Financial toxicity is emerging as an important patient-centered outcome and is understudied in prostate cancer patients. We sought to understand the association between financial burden and treatment regret in men with localized prostate cancer to better evaluate the role of financial discussions in patient counseling. METHODS: Utilizing the Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation dataset, we identified all men accrued between 2011 and 2012 who underwent surgery, radiation, or active surveillance for localized prostate cancer. Financial burden and treatment regret were assessed at 3- and 5-year follow-up. The association between financial burden and regret was assessed using multivariable longitudinal logistic regression controlling for demographic and disease characteristics, treatment, functional outcomes, and patient expectations. RESULTS: Of the 2924 eligible patients, regret and financial burden assessments for 3- and/or 5-year follow-up were available for 81% (n = 2359). After adjustment for relevant covariates, financial burden from ""finances in general"" was associated with treatment regret at 3 years (odds ratio [OR] = 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.33 to 4.57; P = .004); however, this association was no longer statistically significant at 5-year follow-up (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.56 to 2.54; P = .7). CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based sample of men with localized prostate cancer, we observed associations between financial burden and treatment regret. Our findings suggest indirect treatment costs, especially during the first 3 years after diagnosis, may impact patients more profoundly than direct costs and are important for inclusion in shared decision making.";0
Smartphone App in Stroke Management: A Narrative Updated Review.;The spread of smartphones and mobile-Health (m-health) has progressively changed clinical practice, implementing access to medical knowledge and communication between doctors and patients. Dedicated software called Applications (or Apps), assists the practitioners in the various phases of clinical practice, from diagnosis to follow-up and therapy management. The impact of this technology is even more important in diseases such as stroke, which are characterized by a complex management that includes several moments: primary prevention, acute phase management, rehabilitation, and secondary prevention. This review aims to evaluate and summarize the available literature on Apps for the clinical management of stroke. We described their potential and weaknesses, discussing potential room for improvement. Medline databases were interrogated for studies concerning guideline-based decision support Apps for stroke management and other medical scenarios from 2007 (introduction of the first iPhone) until January 2022. We found 551 studies. Forty-three papers were included because they fitted the scope of the review. Based on their purpose, Apps were classified into three groups: primary prevention Apps, acute stroke management Apps, and post-acute stroke Apps. We described the aim of each App and, when available, the results of clinical studies. For acute stroke, several Apps have been designed with the primary purpose of helping communication and sharing of patients' clinical data among healthcare providers. However, interactive systems Apps aiming to assist clinicians are still lacking, and this field should be developed because it may improve stroke patients' management.;0
Construction and Validation of Prognosis Nomogram for Metastatic Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Population-Based Study.;Purpose: This study aimed to establish a nomogram to predict overall survival in lung squamous cell carcinoma patients with metastasis for clinical decision-making. Methods: We investigated lung squamous cell carcinoma patients diagnosed with stage M1 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Final Results database between 2010 and 2015. They were divided into training cohort and validation cohort. In the training cohort, statistically significant prognostic factors were identified using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, and an individualized nomogram model was developed. The model was evaluated by C-index, area under the curve, calibration plot, decision curve analysis, and risk group stratification. Results: In total, 9910 patients were included in our study, including 6937 in the training cohort and 2937 in the validation cohort. Factors containing age, T stage, N stage, bone metastasis, brain metastasis, liver metastasis, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy were independent prognostic factors for overall survival and were used in the construction of the nomogram. The C-index in the training cohort and validation cohort were 0.711 (95% confidenc interval: 0.705-0.717) and 0.707 (95% confidenc interval: 0.697-0.717), respectively. The time-dependent area under the curve of both groups was higher than 0.7 within 5 years. Calibration plots indicated that the nomogram-predicted survival was consistent with the recorded 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year prognoses. Furthermore, decision curve analysis revealed that the nomogram was clinically useful and had a better discriminative ability to recognize patients at high risk than the TNM criteria-based tumor staging. And then we developed an overall survival risk classification system based on the nomogram total points for each patient, which divided all patients into a high-risk group and a low-risk group. Finally, we implemented this nomogram in a free online tool. Conclusion: We constructed a nomogram and a corresponding risk classification system predicting the overall survival of lung squamous cell carcinoma patients with metastasis. These tools can assist in patients' counseling and guide treatment decision-making.;0
Construction and validation of nomograms based on the log odds of positive lymph nodes to predict the prognosis of lung neuroendocrine tumors.;BACKGROUND: This research aimed to investigate the predictive performance of log odds of positive lymph nodes (LODDS) for the long-term prognosis of patients with node-positive lung neuroendocrine tumors (LNETs). METHODS: We collected 506 eligible patients with resected N1/N2 classification LNETs from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 2004 and 2015. The study cohort was split into derivation cohort (n=300) and external validation cohort (n=206) based on different geographic regions. Nomograms were constructed based on the derivation cohort and validated using the external validation cohort to predict the 1-, 3-, and 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with LNETs. The accuracy and clinical practicability of nomograms were tested by Harrell's concordance index (C-index), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), net reclassification improvement (NRI), calibration plots, and decision curve analyses. RESULTS: The Cox proportional-hazards model showed the high LODDS group (-0.79</=LODDS) had significantly higher mortality compared to those in the low LODDS group (LODDS<-0.79) for both CSS and OS. In addition, age at diagnosis, sex, histotype, type of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were also chosen as predictors in Cox regression analyses using stepwise Akaike information criterion method and included in the nomograms. The values of C-index, NRI, and IDI proved that the established nomograms were better than the conventional eighth edition of the TNM staging system. The calibration plots for predictions of the 1-, 3-, and 5-year CSS/OS were in excellent agreement. Decision curve analyses showed that the nomograms had value in terms of clinical application. CONCLUSIONS: We created visualized nomograms for CSS and OS of LNET patients, facilitating clinicians to bring individually tailored risk assessment and therapy.;0
Use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in cancer multidisciplinary team meetings: an explorative study based on EU healthcare professionals.;OBJECTIVES: Multidisciplinary teams in cancer care are increasingly using information and communication technology (ICT), hospital health information system (HIS) functionalities and ICT-driven care components. We aimed to explore the use of these tools in multidisciplinary team meetings (MTMs) and to identify the critical challenges posed by their adoption based on the perspective of professionals representatives from European scientific societies. DESIGN: This qualitative study used discussion of cases and focus group technique to generate data. Thematic analysis was applied. SETTING: Healthcare professionals working in a multidisciplinary cancer care environment. PARTICIPANTS: Selection of informants was carried out by European scientific societies in accordance with professionals' degree of experience in adopting the implementation of ICT and from different health systems. RESULTS: Professionals representatives of 9 European scientific societies were involved. Up to 10 ICTs, HIS functionalities and care components are embedded in the informational and decision-making processes along three stages of MTMs. ICTs play a key role in opening MTMs to other institutions (eg, by means of molecular tumour boards) and information types (eg, patient-reported outcome measures), and in contributing to the internal efficiency of teams. While ICTs and care components have their own challenges, the information technology context is characterised by the massive generation of unstructured data, the lack of interoperability between systems from different hospitals and HIS that are conceived to store and classify information rather than to work with it. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of an MTM model that is better integrated in the wider health system context and incorporates inputs from patients and support systems make traditional meetings more dynamic and interconnected. Although these changes signal a second transition in the development process of multidisciplinary teams, they occur in a context marked by clear gaps between the information and management needs of MTMs and the adequacy of current HIS.;0
Framework for health care quality and evidence-based practice in radiology departments: A regional study on radiographer's perceptions.;"INTRODUCTION: The main goals of this study were to describe, in an integrated and multidimensional way, the conditions related to the quality of care in radiology departments from Algarve (Portugal), to assess the perspective of radiographers on the use of scientific evidence in clinical practice and to validate a model that characterizes the conditions for continuous improvement. METHODS: A cross sectional study was performed in four radiology departments from public and private healthcare facilities from Algarve region (Portugal). A paper-based survey was sent to all radiographers to assess the quality systems implemented in their radiology departments and their perspective on the use of scientific evidence in clinical practice. RESULTS: In total, 62 radiographers (61.4%) completed the survey. The quality dimensions that obtained the highest degree of compliance were the existence of quality assurance and improvement activities (43.0%), existence of standards in clinical practice of radiographers (42.7%) and the existence of special provisions (37.6%). The quality dimension related to patient's involvement was the one with the lowest level of compliance. Moreover, from the radiographers perspective, positive responses were obtained related to evidence-based actions (83.0%), sources of evidence (76.0%) and the significance of research activities (74.0%). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that a new framework based on four factors (Support for Information; Organizational Capability to Technical Quality of Care; Patient Involvement and Evidence-Based Radiology), should be considered in the establishment of strategic policies that better define the provision of diagnostic procedures and professional practices in radiology departments from Algarve region, based on quality improvement systems and better patient safety. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: There is a need to include patients in the decision-making process, to involve radiographers in quality assurance and improvement activities and to implement quality monitoring mechanisms within radiology departments under study.";0
A Multimedia Strategy to Integrate Introductory Broad-Based Radiation Science Education in US Medical Schools.;US physicians in multiple specialties who order or conduct radiological procedures lack formal radiation science education and thus sometimes order procedures of limited benefit or fail to order what is necessary. To this end, a multidisciplinary expert group proposed an introductory broad-based radiation science educational program for US medical schools. Suggested preclinical elements of the curriculum include foundational education on ionizing and nonionizing radiation (eg, definitions, dose metrics, and risk measures) and short- and long-term radiation-related health effects as well as introduction to radiology, radiation therapy, and radiation protection concepts. Recommended clinical elements of the curriculum would impart knowledge and practical experience in radiology, fluoroscopically guided procedures, nuclear medicine, radiation oncology, and identification of patient subgroups requiring special considerations when selecting specific ionizing or nonionizing diagnostic or therapeutic radiation procedures. Critical components of the clinical program would also include educational material and direct experience with patient-centered communication on benefits of, risks of, and shared decision making about ionizing and nonionizing radiation procedures and on health effects and safety requirements for environmental and occupational exposure to ionizing and nonionizing radiation. Overarching is the introduction to evidence-based guidelines for procedures that maximize clinical benefit while limiting unnecessary risk. The content would be further developed, directed, and integrated within the curriculum by local faculties and would address multiple standard elements of the Liaison Committee on Medical Education and Core Entrustable Professional Activities for Entering Residency of the Association of American Medical Colleges.;0
Construction of a predictive model for radiation proctitis after radiotherapy for female pelvic tumors based on machine learning.;OBJECTIVES: Radiation therapy is a main method for female pelvic malignancies, which can cause some adverse reactions, such as radiation proctitis (RP). The incidence of RP is highly positively correlated with radiation dose. There is an urgent need for a scientific method to accurately predict the occurrence of RP to help doctors make clinical decisions. In this study, based on the clinical data of female pelvic tumor patients and dosimetric parameters of radiotherapy, the random forest method was used to screen the hub features related to the occurrence of RP, and then a machine learning algorithm was used to construct a risk prediction model for the occurrence of RP, in order to provide technical support and theoretical basis for the prediction and prevention of RP. METHODS: A total of 100 female patients with pelvic tumors, who received static three-dimensional conformal intensity-modulated radiation therapy in the Department of Radiation Oncology of the Affiliated Hospital of Xiangnan University from January 2019 to December 2020, were retrospectively collected, and their clinically relevant data and radiotherapy planning system data were collected. During radiotherapy and 18 months after radiotherapy, 35 cases developed RP (RP group), and the remaining 65 cases had no RP (non-RP group). The clinical and dosimetric characteristics of patients were ranked by the importance of random forest algorithm, and the independent prognostic characteristics associated with the occurrence of RP were selected for machine learning modeling. A total of 6 machine learning algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, logistic regression, lightweight gradient boosting machines, Gaussian naive Bayes, and adaptive enhancement were used to build models. The performance of the model was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and F1 score. Finally, the random forest model was determined as the prediction model, and the calibration curve and decision curve of the prediction model were drawn to evaluate the accuracy and clinical benefit of the model. RESULTS: The parameters for random forest prediction model in the training set were as follow: AUC, 1.000, accuracy, 0.988, sensitivity, 1.000, specificity, 1.000, positive predictive value, 1.000, negative predictive value, 0.981, and F1 score, 1.000. In validation set, AUC was 0.713, accuracy was 0.640, sensitivity was 0.618, specificity was 0.822, positive predictive value was 0.500, negative predictive value was 0.656, and F1 score was 0.440. Random forest showed high predictive performance. Moreover, the Brief of the calibration curve for the prediction model was 0.178, the prediction accuracy was high, and the decision curve showed that the prediction model could benefit clinically. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the clinical and dosimetric parameters for the female pelvic tumor patients, the prediction model of radiation proctitis constructed by random forest algorithm has high predictive ability and strong clinical usability.;0
A novel nomogram for predicting long-term heart-disease specific survival among older female primary breast cancer patients that underwent chemotherapy: A real-world data retrospective cohort study.;BACKGROUND: The past decade has witnessed an improvement in survival rates for breast cancer, with significant inroads achieved in diagnosis and treatment approaches. Even though chemotherapy is effective for this patient population, cardiotoxicity remains a major challenge, especially in older people. It has been established that cardiovascular events are a major cause of death in older female primary breast cancer patients that underwent chemotherapy. In the present study, the independent prognostic factors were identified to develop a novel nomogram for predicting long-term heart disease-specific survival (HDSS) and improving patient management. METHOD: Older female primary breast cancer patients that underwent chemotherapy from 2010 to 2015 were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and randomly assigned to a training cohort and a validation cohort at a ratio of 7:3. HDSS was the primary endpoint of this study. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted on the training cohort to identify independent prognostic factors of HDSS and construct a nomogram to predict the 5- and 8-year HDSS. The performance of the constructed nomogram was evaluated by calibration curve, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and decision curve analyses. Finally, a risk classification system was constructed to assist in patient management. RESULT: A total of 16,340 patients were included in this study. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified six independent prognostic factors: age, race, tumor stage, marital status, surgery, and radiotherapy. A nomogram based on these six factors yielded excellent performance, with areas under the curve of the ROC for 5- and 8-year HDSS of 0.759 and 0.727 in the training cohort and 0.718 and 0.747 in the validation cohort. Moreover, the established risk classification system could effectively identify patients at low-, middle-, and high- risk of heart disease-associated death and achieve targeted management. CONCLUSION: Independent prognostic factors of HDSS in older female primary breast cancer patients that underwent chemotherapy were determined in this study. A novel nomogram for predicting 5- and 8-year HDSS in this patient population was also established and validated to help physicians during clinical decision-making and screen high-risk patients to improve outcomes.;0
Demographics, Outcomes, and Risk Factors for Patients with Sarcoma and COVID-19: A CCC19-Registry Based Retrospective Cohort Study.;BACKGROUND: Patients with sarcoma often require individualized treatment strategies and are likely to receive aggressive immunosuppressive therapies, which may place them at higher risk for severe COVID-19. We aimed to describe demographics, risk factors, and outcomes for patients with sarcoma and COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with sarcoma and COVID-19 reported to the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) registry (NCT04354701) from 17 March 2020 to 30 September 2021. Demographics, sarcoma histologic type, treatments, and COVID-19 outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: of 281 patients, 49% (n = 139) were hospitalized, 33% (n = 93) received supplemental oxygen, 11% (n = 31) were admitted to the ICU, and 6% (n = 16) received mechanical ventilation. A total of 23 (8%) died within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and 44 (16%) died overall at the time of analysis. When evaluated by sarcoma subtype, patients with bone sarcoma and COVID-19 had a higher mortality rate than patients from a matched SEER cohort (13.5% vs 4.4%). Older age, poor performance status, recent systemic anti-cancer therapy, and lung metastases all contributed to higher COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with sarcoma have high rates of severe COVID-19 and those with bone sarcoma may have the greatest risk of death.;0
Women with gynaecological cancer awaiting radiotherapy: Self-reported wellbeing, general psychological distress, symptom distress, sexual function, and supportive care needs.;OBJECTIVE: To better serve women with gynaecological cancers, we need a sound understanding of their health, wellbeing and needs. This study sought to explore these issues in a sample of Australian women before commencing curative radiotherapy. METHODS: We undertook a secondary analysis of baseline data from a supportive care trial (n = 311). Descriptive statistics were used to summarise responses to measures of wellbeing, general psychological distress, symptom distress, sexual function and vaginal changes, and supportive care needs. Pre-specified regression models were used to examine sources of variation in wellbeing and sexual function. RESULTS: Women reported lower emotional, functional and physical wellbeing than population norms (all p < 0.001). The prevalence of general psychological distress was 31% (95% CI 26-36%). Distress caused by physical symptoms was typically low. Health system and information needs comprised eight of the top ten moderate-to-high supportive care needs. Most women reported no change in interest for physical contact or sex compared to pre-diagnosis, but some sexually active women (16-24%) reported smaller vaginal size, increased dryness, and more pain on intercourse. General psychological distress was a robust marker of poorer wellbeing and sexual function. CONCLUSIONS: Before radiotherapy, a substantial minority of women with gynaecological cancers experience general psychological distress, reduced wellbeing and moderate-to-high health system and information needs. A model of comprehensive care incorporating assessment of unmet needs, general psychological distress, and sexual issues is recommended. Healthcare providers may require training to elicit and respond to a constellation of interrelated issues and access relevant services for women requiring additional support.;0
Learning a confidence score and the latent space of a new supervised autoencoder for diagnosis and prognosis in clinical metabolomic studies.;BACKGROUND: Presently, there is a wide variety of classification methods and deep neural network approaches in bioinformatics. Deep neural networks have proven their effectiveness for classification tasks, and have outperformed classical methods, but they suffer from a lack of interpretability. Therefore, these innovative methods are not appropriate for decision support systems in healthcare. Indeed, to allow clinicians to make informed and well thought out decisions, the algorithm should provide the main pieces of information used to compute the predicted diagnosis and/or prognosis, as well as a confidence score for this prediction. METHODS: Herein, we used a new supervised autoencoder (SAE) approach for classification of clinical metabolomic data. This new method has the advantage of providing a confidence score for each prediction thanks to a softmax classifier and a meaningful latent space visualization and to include a new efficient feature selection method, with a structured constraint, which allows for biologically interpretable results. RESULTS: Experimental results on three metabolomics datasets of clinical samples illustrate the effectiveness of our SAE and its confidence score. The supervised autoencoder provides an accurate localization of the patients in the latent space, and an efficient confidence score. Experiments show that the SAE outperforms classical methods (PLS-DA, Random Forests, SVM, and neural networks (NN)). Furthermore, the metabolites selected by the SAE were found to be biologically relevant. CONCLUSION: In this paper, we describe a new efficient SAE method to support diagnostic or prognostic evaluation based on metabolomics analyses.;0
Patient-reported Outcomes After External Beam Radiotherapy With Low Dose Rate Brachytherapy Boost vs Radical Prostatectomy for Localized Prostate Cancer: Five-year Results From a Prospective Comparative Effectiveness Study.;"PURPOSE: Data comparing radical prostatectomy and external beam radiation therapy with low dose rate brachytherapy boost are lacking. To better guide shared decision making regarding treatment, we compared patient reported outcomes through 5 years following radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy with low dose rate brachytherapy boost for localized prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2011-2012, men aged <80 years with localized prostate adenocarcinoma were enrolled and followed longitudinally. Patient reported outcomes included the Expanded Prostate Index Composite. Regression models adjusted for baseline scores and covariates were constructed. RESULTS: The study population included 112 men treated with external beam radiation therapy with low dose rate brachytherapy boost and 1,553 treated with radical prostatectomy. Compared to radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy with low dose rate brachytherapy boost was associated with clinically meaningful worse urinary irritative/obstructive (adjusted mean score difference [95% confidence interval]: 5.0 [-8.7, -1.3]; P = .008 at 5 years) and better urinary incontinence function (13.3 [7.7, 18.9]; P < .001 at 5 years) through 5 years. Urinary function bother was similar between groups (P > .4 at all timepoints). Treatment with external beam radiation therapy with low dose rate brachytherapy boost was associated with worse bowel function (-4.0 [-6.9, -1.1]; P = .006 at 5 years) through 5 years compared to radical prostatectomy. Treatment with external beam radiation therapy with low dose rate brachytherapy boost was associated with better sexual function at 1 year (12.0 [6.5, 17.5]; P < .001 at 1 year) compared to radical prostatectomy, but there was insufficient evidence to reject the supposition that no difference was seen at 3 or 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy with low dose rate brachytherapy boost was associated with clinically meaningful worse urinary irritative/obstructive and bowel functions but better urinary incontinence function through 5 years after treatment. These patient-reported functional outcomes may clarify treatment expectations and help inform treatment choices for localized prostate cancer.";0
ExacTrac Dynamic workflow evaluation: Combined surface optical/thermal imaging and X-ray positioning.;In modern radiotherapy (RT), especially for stereotactic radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery treatments, image guidance is essential. Recently, the ExacTrac Dynamic (EXTD) system, a new combined surface-guided RT and image-guided RT (IGRT) system for patient positioning, monitoring, and tumor targeting, was introduced in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to provide more information about the geometric accuracy of EXTD and its workflow in a clinical environment. The surface optical/thermal- and the stereoscopic X-ray imaging positioning systems of EXTD was evaluated and compared to cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Additionally, the congruence with the radiation isocenter was tested. A Winston Lutz test was executed several times over 1 year, and repeated end-to-end positioning tests were performed. The magnitude of the displacements between all systems, CBCT, stereoscopic X-ray, optical-surface imaging, and MV portal imaging was within the submillimeter range, suggesting that the image guidance provided by EXTD is accurate at any couch angle. Additionally, results from the evaluation of 14 patients with intracranial tumors treated with open-face masks are reported, and limited differences with a maximum of 0.02 mm between optical/thermal- and stereoscopic X-ray imaging were found. As the optical/thermal positioning system showed a comparable accuracy to other IGRT systems, and due to its constant monitoring capability, it can be an efficient tool for detecting intra-fractional motion and for real-time tracking of the surface position during RT.;0
Molecular classification and outcome of children with rare CNS embryonal tumors: results from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital including the multi-center SJYC07 and SJMB03 clinical trials.;"Methylation profiling has radically transformed our understanding of tumors previously called central nervous system primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors (CNS-PNET). While this marks a momentous step toward defining key differences, reclassification has thrown treatment into disarray. To shed light on response to therapy and guide clinical decision-making, we report outcomes and molecular features of children with CNS-PNETs from two multi-center risk-adapted studies (SJMB03 for patients >/= 3 years; SJYC07 for patients < 3 years) complemented by a non-protocol institutional cohort. Seventy patients who had a histological diagnosis of CNS-PNET or CNS embryonal tumor from one of the new categories that has supplanted CNS-PNET were included. This cohort was molecularly characterized by DNA methylation profiling (n = 70), whole-exome sequencing (n = 53), RNA sequencing (n = 20), and germline sequencing (n = 28). Clinical characteristics were detailed, and treatment was divided into craniospinal irradiation (CSI)-containing (SJMB03 and SJMB03-like) and CSI-sparing therapy (SJYC07 and SJYC07-like). When the cohort was analyzed in its entirety, no differences were observed in the 5-year survival rates even when CSI-containing therapy was compared to CSI-sparing therapy. However, when analyzed by DNA methylation molecular grouping, significant survival differences were observed, and treatment particulars provided suggestions of therapeutic response. Patients with CNS neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation (CNS-NB-FOXR2) had a 5-year event-free survival (EFS)/overall survival (OS) of 66.7% +/- 19.2%/83.3% +/- 15.2%, and CIC rearranged sarcoma (CNS-SARC-CIC) had a 5-year EFS/OS both of 57.1% +/- 18.7% with most receiving regimens that contained radiation (focal or CSI) and multidrug chemotherapy. Patients with high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with BCOR alteration (HGNET-BCOR) had abysmal responses to upfront chemotherapy-only regimens (5-year EFS = 0%), but survival extended with salvage radiation after progression [5-year OS = 53.6% +/- 20.1%]. Patients with embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) or high-grade glioma/glioblastoma multiforme (HGG/GBM) did not respond favorably to any modality (5-year EFS/OS = 10.7 +/- 5.8%/17.9 +/- 7.2%, and 10% +/- 9.0%/10% +/- 9.0%, respectively). As an accompaniment, we have assembled this data onto an interactive website to allow users to probe and query the cases. By reporting on a carefully matched clinical and molecular cohort, we provide the needed insight for future clinical management.";0
New concepts in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.;Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death and occurs mainly in the context of chronic liver disease at cirrhosis stage. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification, first established in 1999, is the most commonly used staging system for HCC in Western countries that link tumor burden, liver function and performance status with prognosis and therapeutic management. Since the first publication of this classification, it has been implemented in several clinical guidelines and recent major therapeutic advances in the management of HCC have modified the therapeutic landscape of HCC. Accordingly, an updated version was recently published in 2022, incorporating an expert clinical decision-making component and the concept of treatment stage migration. This update also introduces the positive results of recent randomized clinical trials, and introduces atezolizumab/bevacizumab (A/B) as a first-line combination regimen for patients with advanced HCC. Finally, the complexity of the management of patients with HCC highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach including input from hepatology, surgery, radiology, medical oncology, and radiation oncology.;0
Predicting the Need for Biopsy to Detect Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in Patients with a Magnetic Resonance Imaging-detected Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System/Likert >/=3 Lesion: Development and Multinational External Validation of the Imperial Rapid Access to Prostate Imaging and Diagnosis Risk Score.;"BACKGROUND: Although multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has high sensitivity, its lower specificity leads to a high prevalence of false-positive lesions requiring biopsy. OBJECTIVE: To develop and externally validate a scoring system for MRI-detected Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS)/Likert >/=3 lesions containing clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The multicentre Rapid Access to Prostate Imaging and Diagnosis (RAPID) pathway included 1189 patients referred to urology due to elevated age-specific prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE); April 27, 2017 to October 25, 2019. INTERVENTION: Visual-registration or image-fusion targeted and systematic transperineal biopsies for an MRI score of >/=4 or 3 + PSA density >/=0.12 ng/ml/ml. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Fourteen variables were used in multivariable logistic regression for Gleason >/=3 + 4 (primary) and Gleason >/=4 + 3, and PROMIS definition 1 (any >/=4 + 3 or >/=6 mm any grade; secondary). Nomograms were created and a decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed. Models with varying complexity were externally validated in 2374 patients from six international cohorts. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The five-item Imperial RAPID risk score used age, PSA density, prior negative biopsy, prostate volume, and highest MRI score (corrected c-index for Gleason >/=3 + 4 of 0.82 and 0.80-0.86 externally). Incorporating family history, DRE, and Black ethnicity within the eight-item Imperial RAPID risk score provided similar outcomes. The DCA showed similar superiority of all models, with net benefit differences increasing in higher threshold probabilities. At 20%, 30%, and 40% of predicted Gleason >/=3 + 4 prostate cancer, the RAPID risk score was able to reduce, respectively, 11%, 21%, and 31% of biopsies against 1.8%, 6.2%, and 14% of missed csPCa (or 9.6%, 17%, and 26% of foregone biopsies, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The Imperial RAPID risk score provides a standardised tool for the prediction of csPCa in patients with an MRI-detected PIRADS/Likert >/=3 lesion and can support the decision for prostate biopsy. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this multinational study, we developed a scoring system incorporating clinical and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics to predict which patients have prostate cancer requiring treatment and which patients can safely forego an invasive prostate biopsy. This model was validated in several other countries.";0
C-arm positioning for standard projections during spinal implant placement.;Fluoroscopy-guided trauma and orthopedic surgeries involve the repeated acquisition of correct anatomy-specific standard projections for guidance, monitoring, and evaluating the surgical result. C-arm positioning is usually performed by hand, involving repeated or even continuous fluoroscopy at a cost of radiation exposure and time. We propose to automate this procedure and estimate the pose update for C-arm repositioning directly from a first X-ray without the need for a patient-specific computed tomography scan (CT) or additional technical equipment. Our method is trained on digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) which uniquely provide ground truth labels for an arbitrary number of training examples. The simulated images are complemented with automatically generated segmentations, landmarks, and with simulated k-wires and screws. To successfully achieve a transfer from simulated to real X-rays, and also to increase the interpretability of results, the pipeline was designed to closely reflect the actual clinical decision-making process followed by spinal neurosurgeons. It explicitly incorporates steps such as region-of-interest (ROI) localization, detection of relevant and view-independent landmarks, and subsequent pose regression. The method was validated on a large human cadaver study simulating a real clinical scenario, including k-wires and screws. The proposed procedure obtained superior C-arm positioning accuracy of dtheta=8.8 degrees +/-4.2 degrees  average improvement (p(t-test)<<0.01), robustness, and generalization capabilities compared to the state-of-the-art direct pose regression framework.;0
A Web-Based Prediction Model for Cancer-Specific Survival of Elderly Patients Undergoing Surgery With Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Study.;OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer (PC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States after lung cancer in global incidence. Elderly male patients over 65 years old account for more than 60% of PC patients, and the impact of surgical treatment on the prognosis of PC patients is controversial. Moreover, there are currently no predictive models that can predict the prognosis of elderly PC patients undergoing surgical treatment. Therefore, we aimed to construct a new nomogram to predict cancer-specific survival (CSS) in elderly PC patients undergoing surgical treatment. METHODS: Data for surgically treated PC patients aged 65 years and older were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to identify independent risk factors for elderly PC patients undergoing surgical treatment. A nomogram of elderly PC patients undergoing surgical treatment was developed based on the multivariate Cox regression model. The consistency index (C-index), the area under the subject operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the calibration curve were used to test the accuracy and discrimination of the predictive model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to examine the potential clinical value of this model. RESULTS: A total of 44,975 elderly PC patients undergoing surgery in 2010-2018 were randomly assigned to the training set (N = 31705) and validation set (N = 13270). the training set was used for nomogram development and the validation set was used for internal validation. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression model analysis showed that age, marriage, TNM stage, surgical style, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, Gleason score(GS), and prostate-specific antigen(PSA) were independent risk factors for CSS in elderly PC patients undergoing surgical treatment. The C index of the training set and validation indices are 0.911(95%CI: 0.899-0.923) and 0.913(95%CI: 0.893-0.933), respectively, indicating that the nomogram has a good discrimination ability. The AUC and the calibration curves also show good accuracy and discriminability. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, our nomogram is the first predictive model for elderly PC patients undergoing surgical treatment, filling the gap in current predictive models for this PC patient population. Our data comes from the SEER database, which is trustworthy and reliable. Moreover, our model has been internally validated in the validation set using the C-index,AUC and the and the calibration curve, showed that the model have good accuracy and reliability, which can help clinicians and patients make better clinical decision-making. Moreover, the DCA results show that our nomogram has a better potential clinical application value than the TNM staging system.;0
Assessment of gamma knife radiosurgery for unruptured cerebral arterioveneus malformations based on multi-parameter radiomics of MRI.;"OBJECTIVE: The treatment of Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for unruptured Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM) remains controversial. A safe, effective and non-invasive method to predict outcome seems attractive for GKS. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a MRI based multi-parameter radiomics model predicting the outcome of GKS for unruptured AVM. METHODS: Eighty-eight unruptured AVM patients who initial underwent GKS between January 2011 and December 2016 in our hospital were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into two groups named as favourable and unfavourable outcome, according to the clinical outcome. Favourable outcome was defined as obliteration without post-SRS hemorrhage or permanent radiation-induced changes (RIC). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to select appropriate clinical features and construct a clinical predicting model. In terms of radiomic model, manually segmentation and radiomics extracted were performed on each AVM lesions. Finally, 1684 radiomics features were extracted and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method combined with Random forest classifier were used for feature selection and model construction. The performance of the radiomics model was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). In addition, the favourable group was further divided into early and late respond subgroup according to the time of obliteration evaluated by 2 years. The selected features were further compared according the respond time. RESULTS: The median duration of neuroimaging follow-up was 65 months, 56 patients showed favourable outcome and 17 patients were observed obliteration within 2 years. The radiomics model constructed by 12 selected features achieved significant higher AUC of 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.87-0.90) than traditional scoring system for predicting AVM outcome. Two selected radiomics features named ""Dependence Variance"" and ""firstorder-Skewness"" were found significant difference between the patients with early or late-respond. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the radiomics features could be successfully used for the pretreatment prediction of outcome for GKS in unruptured AVMs, which is helpful for decision-making process on unruptured AVM patients.";0
UK reporting radiographers' perceptions of AI in radiographic image interpretation - Current perspectives and future developments.;INTRODUCTION: Radiographer reporting is accepted practice in the UK. With a national shortage of radiographers and radiologists, artificial intelligence (AI) support in reporting may help minimise the backlog of unreported images. Modern AI is not well understood by human end-users. This may have ethical implications and impact human trust in these systems, due to over- and under-reliance. This study investigates the perceptions of reporting radiographers about AI, gathers information to explain how they may interact with AI in future and identifies features perceived as necessary for appropriate trust in these systems. METHODS: A Qualtrics(R) survey was designed and piloted by a team of UK AI expert radiographers. This paper reports the third part of the survey, open to reporting radiographers only. RESULTS: 86 responses were received. Respondents were confident in how an AI reached its decision (n = 53, 62%). Less than a third of respondents would be confident communicating the AI decision to stakeholders. Affirmation from AI would improve confidence (n = 49, 57%) and disagreement would make respondents seek a second opinion (n = 60, 70%). There is a moderate trust level in AI for image interpretation. System performance data and AI visual explanations would increase trust. CONCLUSIONS: Responses indicate that AI will have a strong impact on reporting radiographers' decision making in the future. Respondents are confident in how an AI makes decisions but less confident explaining this to others. Trust levels could be improved with explainable AI solutions. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This survey clarifies UK reporting radiographers' perceptions of AI, used for image interpretation, highlighting key issues with AI integration.;0
Two Specialists, Two Recommendations: Discordance Between Urologists' & Radiation Oncologists' Prostate Cancer Treatment Recommendations.;"OBJECTIVE: To examine the treatment recommendation patterns among urologists and radiation oncologists, the level of concordance or discordance between physician recommendations, and the association between physician recommendations and the treatment that patients received. METHOD: The study was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial conducted November 2010 to April 2014 (NCT02053389). Eligible participants were patients from the trial who saw both specialists. The primary outcome was physician recommendations that were scored using an adapted version of the validated PhyReCS coding system. Secondary outcomes included concordance between physician recommendations and the treatment patients received. RESULTS: Participants were 108 patients (Mean age 61.9 years; range 43-82; 87% non-Hispanic White). Urologists were more likely to recommend surgery (79% of recommendations) and radiation oncologists were more likely to recommend radiation (68% of recommendations). Recommendations from the urologists and radiation oncologists were concordant for only 33 patients (30.6%). Most patients received a treatment that both physicians recommended (59%); however, 35% received a treatment that only one of their physicians recommended. When discordant, urologists more often recommended surgery and radiation oncologists recommended radiation and surgery as equally appropriate options. CONCLUSION: Urologists and radiation oncologists are more likely to differ than agree in their treatment recommendations for the same patients with clinically localized prostate cancer and more likely to favor treatment aligned with their specialty. Additional studies are needed to better understand how patients make decisions after meeting with two different specialists to inform the development of best practices within oncology clinics.";0
A multi-institutional prediction model to estimate the risk of recurrence and mortality after mastectomy for T1-2N1 breast cancer.;"BACKGROUND: Post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) in women with pathologic stage T1-2N1M0 breast cancer is controversial. METHODS: Data from five North American institutions including women undergoing mastectomy without neoadjuvant therapy with pT1-2N1M0 breast cancer treated from 2006 to 2015 were pooled for analysis. Competing-risks regression was performed to identify factors associated with locoregional recurrence (LRR), distant metastasis (DM), overall recurrence (OR), and breast cancer mortality (BCM). RESULTS: A total of 3532 patients were included for analysis with a median follow-up time among survivors of 6.8 years (interquartile range [IQR], 4.5-9.5 years). The 2154 (61%) patients who received PMRT had significantly more adverse risk factors than those patients not receiving PMRT: younger age, larger tumors, more positive lymph nodes, lymphovascular invasion, extracapsular extension, and positive margins (p < .05 for all). On competing risk regression analysis, receipt of PMRT was significantly associated with a decreased risk of LRR (hazard ratio [HR], 0.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.31; p < .001) and OR (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.94; p = .011). Model performance metrics for each end point showed good discrimination and calibration. An online prediction model to estimate predicted risks for each outcome based on individual patient and tumor characteristics was created from the model. CONCLUSIONS: In a large multi-institutional cohort of patients, PMRT for T1-2N1 breast cancer was associated with a significant reduction in locoregional and overall recurrence after accounting for known prognostic factors. An online calculator was developed to aid in personalized decision-making regarding PMRT in this population.";0
Development and validation of a prognostic prediction model including the minor lymphatic pathway for distant metastases in cervical cancer patients.;"To develop and validate a prognostic model, including the minor lymphatic pathway (internal iliac and presacral nodes). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. PARTICIPANTS: Locally advanced cervical cancer underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy. SAMPLE SIZE: 397 and 384 patients in the development and validation data set. PREDICTORS: Our new nodal staging system with the minor lymphatic pathway. OUTCOME: Distant metastases. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Cox regression; net reclassification improvement (NRI) and decision curve analysis (DCA). Our new nodal system was the strongest predictor. The predictors in the final model were new nodal system, tumor stage, adenocarcinoma, initial hemoglobin, tumor size and age. The nodal system and the pretreatment model had concordance indices of 0.661 and 0.708, respectively, with good calibration curves. Compared to the OUTBACK eligibility criteria, the nodal system showed NRI for both cases (22%) and controls (16%). The pretreatment model showed NRI for cases (31%) and controls (18%). DCA in both models showed threshold probability of 15% and 12%, respectively, when compared with 24% in OUTBACK eligibility criteria. Our new nodal staging system and the pretreatment model could differentiate between high-risk and low-risk patients, thus facilitating decisions to provide more aggressive treatment to prevent distant metastases.";0
Nomogram model and risk score predicting overall survival and guiding clinical decision in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma: an observational study using SEER population-based data.;INTRODUCTION: This study developed a prognostic nomogram of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) for purpose of discussing independent risk factors for HL patients with Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. METHODS: We collected data of HL patients from 2010 to 2015 from the SEER database and divided it into two cohorts: the training and the verification cohort. Then the univariate and the multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted in the training, the verification as well as the total cohort, after which the intersection of variables with statistical significance was taken as independent risk factors to establish the nomogram. The predictive ability of the nomogram was validated by the Concordance Index. Additionally, the calibration curve and receiver operating characteristic curve were implemented to evaluate the accuracy and discrimination. Finally, we obtained 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rates of HL patients. RESULTS: 10 912 patients were eligible for the study. We discovered that Derived American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage Group, lymphoma subtype, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were four independent risk factors affecting the prognosis of HL patients. The 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rates for high-risk patients were 85.4%, 79.9% and 76.0%, respectively. It was confirmed that patients with stage I or II had a better prognosis. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy had a positive impact on HL outcomes. However, patients with lymphocyte-depleted HL were of poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram we constructed could better predict the prognosis of patients with HL. Patients with HL had good long-term outcomes but novel therapies are still in need for fewer complications.;0
Cardiovascular Disease Risk Modeling for Astronauts: Making the Leap From Earth to Space.;NASA has recently completed several long-duration missions to the International Space Station and is solidifying plans to return to the Moon, with an eye toward Mars and beyond. As NASA pushes the boundaries of human space exploration, the hazards of spaceflight, including space radiation, levy an increasing burden on astronaut health and performance. The cardiovascular system may be especially vulnerable due to the combined impacts of space radiation exposure, lack of gravity, and other spaceflight hazards. On Earth, the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) following moderate to high radiation doses is well-established from clinical, environmental, and occupational exposures (largely from gamma- and x-rays). Less is known about CVD risks associated with high-energy charged ions found in space and increasingly used in radiotherapy applications on Earth, making this a critical area of investigation for occupational radiation protection. Assessing CVD risk is complicated by its multifactorial nature, where an individual's risk is strongly influenced by factors such as family history, blood pressure, and lipid profiles. These known risk factors provide the basis for development of a variety of clinical risk prediction models (CPMs) that inform the likelihood of medical outcomes over a defined period. These tools improve clinical decision-making, personalize care, and support primary prevention of CVD. They may also be useful for individualizing risk estimates for CVD following radiation exposure both in the clinic and in space. In this review, we summarize unique aspects of radiation risk assessment for astronauts, and we evaluate the most widely used CVD CPMs for their use in NASA radiation risk assessment applications. We describe a comprehensive dual-use risk assessment framework that supports both clinical care and operational management of space radiation health risks using quantitative metrics. This approach is a first step in using personalized medicine for radiation risk assessment to support safe and productive spaceflight and long-term quality of life for NASA astronauts.;0
System dynamic modelling of healthcare associated influenza -a tool for infection control.;BACKGROUND: The transmission dynamics of influenza virus within healthcare settings are not fully understood. Capturing the interplay between host, viral and environmental factors is difficult using conventional research methods. Instead, system dynamic modelling may be used to illustrate the complex scenarios including non-linear relationships and multiple interactions which occur within hospitals during a seasonal influenza epidemic. We developed such a model intended as a support for health-care providers in identifying potentially effective control strategies to prevent influenza transmission. METHODS: By using computer simulation software, we constructed a system dynamic model to illustrate transmission dynamics within a large acute-care hospital. We used local real-world clinical and epidemiological data collected during the season 2016/17, as well as data from the national surveillance programs and relevant publications to form the basic structure of the model. Multiple stepwise simulations were performed to identify the relative effectiveness of various control strategies and to produce estimates of the accumulated number of healthcare-associated influenza cases per season. RESULTS: Scenarios regarding the number of patients exposed for influenza virus by shared room and the extent of antiviral prophylaxis and treatment were investigated in relation to estimations of influenza vaccine coverage, vaccine effectiveness and inflow of patients with influenza. In total, 680 simulations were performed, of which each one resulted in an estimated number per season. The most effective preventive measure identified by our model was administration of antiviral prophylaxis to exposed patients followed by reducing the number of patients receiving care in shared rooms. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents an system dynamic model that can be used to capture the complex dynamics of in-hospital transmission of viral infections and identify potentially effective interventions to prevent healthcare-associated influenza infections. Our simulations identified antiviral prophylaxis as the most effective way to control in-hospital influenza transmission.;0
Training, validation, and clinical implementation of a deep-learning segmentation model for radiotherapy of loco-regional breast cancer.;AIM: To train and validate a comprehensive deep-learning (DL) segmentation model for loco-regional breast cancer with the aim of clinical implementation. METHODS: DL segmentation models for 7 clinical target volumes (CTVs) and 11 organs at risk (OARs) were trained on 170 left-sided breast cancer cases from two radiotherapy centres in Norway. Another 30 patient cases were used for validation, which included the evaluation of Dice similarity coefficient and Hausdorff distance, qualitative scoring according to clinical usability, and relevant dosimetric parameters. The manual inter-observer variation (IOV) was also evaluated and served as a benchmark. Delineation of the target volumes followed the ESTRO guidelines. RESULTS: Based on the geometric similarity metrics, the model performed significantly better than IOV for most structures. Qualitatively, no or only minor corrections were required for 14% and 71% of the CTVs and 72% and 26% of the OARs, respectively. Major corrections were required for 15% of the CTVs and 2% of the OARs. The most frequent corrections occurred in the cranial and caudal parts of the structures. The dose coverage, based on D98 > 95%, was fulfilled for 100% and 89% of the breast and lymph node CTVs, respectively. No differences in OAR dose parameters were considered clinically relevant. The model was implemented in a commercial treatment planning system, which generates the structures in 1.5 min. CONCLUSION: Convincing results from the validation led to the decision of clinical implementation. The clinical use will be monitored regarding applicability, standardization and efficiency.;0
Further refining 2020 ESGO/ESTRO/ESP molecular risk classes in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer: A propensity score-matched analysis.;BACKGROUND: The integration of molecular features with clinicopathological findings in endometrial cancer classification seems to be able to significantly refine risk assessment. Nevertheless, clinical management remains challenging, and different therapeutic options are available for each class. Further prognostic characterization of the subgroups within each risk class could be helpful in the decision-making process. METHODS: This study evaluated the role of the 2020 European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO)/European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO)/European Society of Pathology (ESP) risk assessment system and the three prognostic profiles adopted in the PORTEC-4a trial in predicting disease-free and overall survival in a retrospective study cohort of patients with early-stage endometrial cancer. Patients were selected according to a 1:2 propensity score matching analysis. Moreover, the sequencing of 29 genes was undertaken for tumor samples. RESULTS: The study included 137 patients. No differences in disease-free or overall survival at 5 years were observed among the 2020 ESGO/ESTRO/ESP risk classes without molecular features (p = .766 and p = .176, respectively). Once molecular features were integrated, the probability of overall survival was significantly different (p = .011). When the three prognostic profiles were applied, the probability of recurrence had a p value of .097, and significant differences were observed in overall survival (p = .004). Among patients experiencing recurrence, 17.6% showed mutations in BRCA1/2, RAD50, BRIP1, and XRCC2, whereas 22.5% had PD-L1-positive expression and an MUTYH mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Further stratification within each risk class according to the most relevant prognostic features could better define the prognosis of patients with early-stage endometrial cancer. Nearly half of the patients who experienced recurrence showed a targetable molecular alteration for which dedicated trials should be encouraged.;0
Artificial intelligence for prediction of treatment outcomes in breast cancer: Systematic review of design, reporting standards, and bias.;BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to personalize treatment strategies for patients with cancer. However, current methodological weaknesses could limit clinical impact. We identified common limitations and suggested potential solutions to facilitate translation of AI to breast cancer management. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and PubMed Central in July 2021. Studies investigating the performance of AI to predict outcomes among patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer were included. Algorithm design and adherence to reporting standards were assessed following the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement. Risk of bias was assessed by using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST), and correspondence with authors to assess data and code availability. RESULTS: Our search identified 1,124 studies, of which 64 were included: 58 had a retrospective study design, with 6 studies with a prospective design. Access to datasets and code was severely limited (unavailable in 77% and 88% of studies, respectively). On request, data and code were made available in 28% and 18% of cases, respectively. Ethnicity was often under-reported (not reported in 52 of 64, 81%), as was model calibration (63/64, 99%). The risk of bias was high in 72% (46/64) of the studies, especially because of analysis bias. CONCLUSION: Development of AI algorithms should involve external and prospective validation, with improved code and data availability to enhance reliability and translation of this promising approach.

Compactness index: a radiosurgery outcome predictor for patients with unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations.;OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study was to define and quantify brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) compactness and to assess its effect on outcomes after Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for unruptured bAVMs. METHODS: Unsupervised machine learning with fuzzy c-means clustering was used to differentiate the tissue constituents of bAVMs on T2-weighted MR images. The percentages of vessel, brain, and CSF were quantified. The proposed compactness index, defined as the ratio of vasculature tissue to brain tissue, categorized bAVM morphology into compact, intermediate, and diffuse types according to the tertiles of this index. The outcomes of interest were complete obliteration and radiation-induced changes (RICs). RESULTS: A total of 209 unruptured bAVMs treated with GKRS were retrospectively included. The median imaging and clinical follow-up periods were 49.2 and 72.3 months, respectively. One hundred seventy-three bAVMs (82.8%) achieved complete obliteration after a median latency period of 43.3 months. The rates of RIC and permanent RIC were 76.1% and 3.8%, respectively. Post-GKRS hemorrhage occurred in 14 patients (6.7%), resulting in an annual bleeding risk of 1.0%. Compact bAVM, smaller bAVM volume, and exclusively superficial venous drainage were independent predictors of complete obliteration. Diffuse bAVM morphology, larger bAVM volume, and higher margin dose were independently associated with RICs. CONCLUSIONS: The compactness index quantitatively describes the compactness of unruptured bAVMs. Moreover, compact bAVMs may have a higher obliteration rate and a smaller risk of RICs than diffuse bAVMs. This finding could help guide decision-making regarding GKRS treatment for patients with unruptured bAVMs.;0
A novel nomogram for predicting cancer-specific survival in women with uterine sarcoma: a large population-based study.;BACKGROUND: Uterine sarcoma (US) is a rare malignant uterine tumor with aggressive behavior and rapid progression. The purpose of this study was to constructa comprehensive nomogram to predict cancer-specific survival (CSS) of patients with US-based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. METHODS: A retrospective population-based study was conducted using data from patients with US between 2010 and 2015 from the SEER database. They were randomly divided into a training cohort and a validation cohort ata 7-to-3 ratio. Multivariate Cox analysis was performed to identify independent prognostic factors. Subsequently, a nomogram was established to predict patient CSS. The discrimination and calibration of the nomogram were evaluated by the concordance index (C-index) and the area under the curve (AUC). Finally, net reclassification improvement (NRI), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), calibration plotting, and decision-curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the benefits of the new prediction model. RESULTS: A total of 3861 patients with US were included in our study. As revealed in multivariate Cox analysis, age at diagnosis, race, marital status, insurance record, tumor size, pathology grade, histological type, SEER stage, AJCC stage, surgery status, radiotherapy status, and chemotherapy status were found to be independent prognostic factors. In our nomogram, pathology grade had strongest correlation with CSS, followed by age at diagnosis and surgery status. Compared to the AJCC staging system, the new nomogram showed better predictive discrimination with a higher C-index in the training and validation cohorts (0.796 and 0.767 vs. 0.706 and 0.713, respectively). Furthermore, the AUC value, calibration plotting, NRI, IDI, and DCA also demonstrated better performance than the traditional system. CONCLUSION: Our study validated the first comprehensive nomogram for US, which could provide more accurate and individualized survival predictions for US patients in clinical practice.;0
Clinician perspectives on clinical decision support systems in lung cancer: Implications for shared decision-making.;"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer treatment decisions are typically made among clinical experts in a multidisciplinary tumour board (MTB) based on clinical data and guidelines. The rise of artificial intelligence and cultural shifts towards patient autonomy are changing the nature of clinical decision-making towards personalized treatments. This can be supported by clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) that generate personalized treatment information as a basis for shared decision-making (SDM). Little is known about lung cancer patients' treatment decisions and the potential for SDM supported by CDSSs. The aim of this study is to understand to what extent SDM is done in current practice and what clinicians need to improve it. OBJECTIVE: To explore (1) the extent to which patient preferences are taken into consideration in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment decisions; (2) clinician perspectives on using CDSSs to support SDM. DESIGN: Mixed methods study consisting of a retrospective cohort study on patient deviation from MTB advice and reasons for deviation, qualitative interviews with lung cancer specialists and observations of MTB discussions and patient consultations. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: NSCLC patients (N = 257) treated at a single radiotherapy clinic and nine lung cancer specialists from six Dutch clinics. RESULTS: We found a 10.9% (n = 28) deviation rate from MTB advice; 50% (n = 14) were due to patient preference, of which 85.7% (n = 12) chose a less intensive treatment than MTB advice. Current MTB recommendations are based on clinician experience, guidelines and patients' performance status. Most specialists (n = 7) were receptive towards CDSSs but cited barriers, such as lack of trust, lack of validation studies and time. CDSSs were considered valuable during MTB discussions rather than in consultations. CONCLUSION: Lung cancer decisions are heavily influenced by clinical guidelines and experience, yet many patients prefer less intensive treatments. CDSSs can support SDM by presenting the harms and benefits of different treatment options rather than giving single treatment advice. External validation of CDSSs should be prioritized. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This study did not involve patients or the public explicitly; however, the study design was informed by prior interviews with volunteers of a cancer patient advocacy group. The study objectives and data collection were supported by Dutch health care insurer CZ for a project titled 'My Best Treatment' that improves patient-centeredness and the lung cancer patient pathway in the Netherlands.";0
Radiation Therapy for Brain Metastases: An ASTRO Clinical Practice Guideline.;PURPOSE: This guideline provides updated evidence-based recommendations addressing recent developments in the management of patients with brain metastases, including advanced radiation therapy techniques such as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and hippocampal avoidance whole brain radiation therapy and the emergence of systemic therapies with central nervous system activity. METHODS: The American Society for Radiation Oncology convened a task force to address 4 key questions focused on the radiotherapeutic management of intact and resected brain metastases from nonhematologic solid tumors. The guideline is based on a systematic review provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Recommendations were created using a predefined consensus-building methodology and system for grading evidence quality and recommendation strength. RESULTS: Strong recommendations are made for SRS for patients with limited brain metastases and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2. Multidisciplinary discussion with neurosurgery is conditionally recommended to consider surgical resection for all tumors causing mass effect and/or that are greater than 4 cm. For patients with symptomatic brain metastases, upfront local therapy is strongly recommended. For patients with asymptomatic brain metastases eligible for central nervous system-active systemic therapy, multidisciplinary and patient-centered decision-making to determine whether local therapy may be safely deferred is conditionally recommended. For patients with resected brain metastases, SRS is strongly recommended to improve local control. For patients with favorable prognosis and brain metastases receiving whole brain radiation therapy, hippocampal avoidance and memantine are strongly recommended. For patients with poor prognosis, early introduction of palliative care for symptom management and caregiver support are strongly recommended. CONCLUSIONS: The task force has proposed recommendations to inform best clinical practices on the use of radiation therapy for brain metastases with strong emphasis on multidisciplinary care.;0
Machine learning application in personalised lung cancer recurrence and survivability prediction.;Machine learning is an important artificial intelligence technique that is widely applied in cancer diagnosis and detection. More recently, with the rise of personalised and precision medicine, there is a growing trend towards machine learning applications for prognosis prediction. However, to date, building reliable prediction models of cancer outcomes in everyday clinical practice is still a hurdle. In this work, we integrate genomic, clinical and demographic data of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and introduce copy number variation (CNV) and mutation information of 15 selected genes to generate predictive models for recurrence and survivability. We compare the accuracy and benefits of three well-established machine learning algorithms: decision tree methods, neural networks and support vector machines. Although the accuracy of predictive models using the decision tree method has no significant advantage, the tree models reveal the most important predictors among genomic information (e.g. KRAS, EGFR, TP53), clinical status (e.g. TNM stage and radiotherapy) and demographics (e.g. age and gender) and how they influence the prediction of recurrence and survivability for both early stage LUAD and LUSC. The machine learning models have the potential to help clinicians to make personalised decisions on aspects such as follow-up timeline and to assist with personalised planning of future social care needs.;0
High-dose radiotherapy and risk-adapted androgen deprivation in localised prostate cancer (DART 01/05): 10-year results of a phase 3 randomised, controlled trial.;"BACKGROUND: The optimal duration of androgen deprivation combined with high-dose radiotherapy in prostate cancer remains controversial. The DART 01/05 trial was designed to determine whether long-term androgen deprivation is superior to short-term androgen deprivation when combined with high-dose radiotherapy. The 5-year results showed that 2 years of adjuvant androgen deprivation combined with high-dose radiotherapy significantly improved biochemical control, metastasis, and overall survival, especially in patients with high-risk disease. In this report, we present the 10-year final results of the trial. METHODS: This open-label, phase 3, randomised, controlled trial was done in ten hospitals in Spain. The eligibility criteria included patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed T1c to T3, N0, and M0 adenocarcinoma of the prostate, according to the 2002 classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer, with intermediate-risk and high-risk factors, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) less than 100 ng/mL, and a Karnofsky performance score of at least 70%. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 4 months of neoadjuvant and concomitant short-term androgen deprivation (STAD) plus high-dose radiotherapy (minimum dose 76 Gy; median dose 78 Gy) or to receive the same treatment followed by 24 months of adjuvant long-term androgen deprivation (LTAD), via a randomisation scheduled generated by Statistical Analysis Software programme (version 9.1) and an interactive web response system. Patients assigned to the STAD group received 4 months of neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation (oral flutamide 750 mg per day or oral bicalutamide 50 mg per day) with subcutaneous goserelin (2 months before and 2 months combined with high-dose radiotherapy). Anti-androgen therapy was added during the first 2 months of treatment. Patients assigned to LTAD continued with goserelin every 3 months for another 24 months. The primary endpoint was biochemical disease-free survival at 5 years. For this 10-year study we analysed overall survival, metastasis-free survival, biochemical disease-free survival, and cause-specific survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is closed and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02175212) and in the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2005-000417-36). FINDINGS: Between Nov 7, 2005, and Dec 20, 2010, 355 patients were enrolled. One patient in the STAD group withdrew from the trial, hence 354 participants were randomly assigned to STAD (n=177) or LTAD (n=177). The median follow-up was 119.4 months (IQR 100.6-124.3). The 10-year biochemical disease-free survival for LTAD was 70.2% (95% CI 63.1-77.3) and for STAD was 62.3% (54.9-69.7; hazard ratio [HR] 0.84; 95% CI 0.50-1.43; p=0.52). At 10 years, overall survival was 78.4% (72.1-84.8) for LTAD and 73.3% (66.6-80.0) for STAD (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.55-1.27; p=0.40), and metastasis-free survival was 76.0% (69.4-82.7) for LTAD and 70.9% (64.0-77.8) for STAD (HR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.37-2.19; p=0.81). For the subgroup of high-risk patients, the 10-year biochemical disease-free survival was 67.2% (57.2-77.2) for LTAD and 53.7% (43.3-64.1) for STAD (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.49-1.64; p=0.73), the 10-year overall survival was 78.5% (69.6-87.3) for LTAD and 67.0% (57.3-76.7) for STAD (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.33-1.01; p=0.054), and the 10-year metastasis-free survival was 76.6% (95% CI 67.6-85.6) for LTAD and 65.0% (55.1-74.8) for STAD (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.33-2.43; p=0.82). Only 11 (3%) of 354 patients died from prostate cancer, all of them in the high-risk subgroup (five in the LTAD group and six in the STAD group). 76 (21%) patients died from other causes (mainly second malignancies in 31 [9%] and cardiovascular disease in 21 [6%]). No treatment-related deaths were observed. INTERPRETATION: After an extended 10-year follow-up, we were unable to support the significant benefit of LTAD reported at 5 years. However, the magnitude of the benefit was clinically relevant in high-risk patients. Intermediate-risk patients treated with high-dose radiotherapy do not benefit from LTAD. A biological characterisation with the inclusion of genomic testing is needed in the decision-making process.

Opportunities to use electronic health record audit logs to improve cancer care.;The rapid adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has created extensive repositories of digitized data that can be used to inform improvements in care delivery, processes, and patient outcomes. While the clinical data captured in EHRs are widely used for such efforts, EHRs also capture audit log data that reflect how users interact with the EHR to deliver care. Automatically collected audit log data provide a unique opportunity for new insights into EHR user behavior and decision-making processes. Here, we provide an overview of audit log data and examples that could be used to improve oncology care and outcomes in four domains: diagnostic reasoning and consumption, care team collaboration and communication, patient outcomes and experience, and provider burnout/fatigue. This data source could identify gaps in performance and care, physician uptake of EHR features that enhance decision-making, and integration of data trends for oncology. Ensuring researchers and oncologists are familiar with the data's potential and developing the data engineering capacity to utilize this rich data source, will expand the breadth of research to improve cancer care.;0
Scoping the psychological support practices of Australian health professionals working with people with primary brain tumor and their families.;OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to scope the psychological support practices of Australian health professionals providing supportive care to adults with primary brain tumor. METHOD: Health professionals from multidisciplinary organizations and cancer support services completed an online survey focused on psychological support for people with brain tumor (PwBT) and family members, and perceived barriers or gaps in support provision. RESULTS: 107 professionals, mainly from psychology (45%), nursing (20%), and social work (10%) backgrounds, completed the survey. Scope of practice differed according to discipline, with psychologists and nurses most likely to screen for psychological distress (71%-76%), and psychologists more typically providing at least one psychological support session (78%). Psychologists were more likely to screen for cognitive impairment (31%), whereas nurses and social workers more commonly provided family-based support (62%-73%). Psychological support was more frequently provided in the long-term management phase (78%) than early post-diagnosis/treatment (45%). System-level barriers to accessing psychological support were most frequently identified, which included limited resources and funding, insufficient staff time, lengthy waitlists and costs, poor service coordination, and lack of staff with brain tumor-specific training. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of psychological support for PwBT varies according to discipline, setting and management phase. Further research on different models of psychosocial care is needed to inform strategies to address organizational and policy factors impacting professionals' scope of practice.;0
Barriers to Oncofertility Care among Female Adolescent Cancer Patients in Canada.;High survival rates in adolescent cancer patients have shifted the medical focus to the long-term outcomes of cancer treatments. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation increase the risk of infertility and infertility-related distress in adolescent cancer patients and survivors. The aims of this narrative review were to (1) describe the psychosocial impacts of cancer-related infertility in adolescents, (2) identify multilevel barriers to fertility preservation (FP) conversations and referrals, and (3) conclude with evidence-based clinical solutions for improving the oncofertility support available to Canadian adolescents. The results of this review revealed that FP decisions occur within the patient, parent, and health care provider (HCP) triad, and are influenced by factors such as parent attitudes, patient maturity, and HCP knowledge. Decision tools and HCP education can promote the occurrence of developmentally appropriate fertility discussions. At the systems level, cost and resource barriers prevent patients from receiving sufficient fertility information and referrals. Clinical models of care (MOCs) can define interdisciplinary roles and referral pathways to improve the integration of oncofertility services into adolescent cancer care. The continued integration of oncofertility care will ensure that all Canadian adolescents receive the exemplary medical and psychological support necessary to make empowered decisions about their own fertility.;0
Computerized Decision Support for Bladder Cancer Treatment Response Assessment in CT Urography: Effect on Diagnostic Accuracy in Multi-Institution Multi-Specialty Study.;This observer study investigates the effect of computerized artificial intelligence (AI)-based decision support system (CDSS-T) on physicians' diagnostic accuracy in assessing bladder cancer treatment response. The performance of 17 observers was evaluated when assessing bladder cancer treatment response without and with CDSS-T using pre- and post-chemotherapy CTU scans in 123 patients having 157 pre- and post-treatment cancer pairs. The impact of cancer case difficulty, observers' clinical experience, institution affiliation, specialty, and the assessment times on the observers' diagnostic performance with and without using CDSS-T were analyzed. It was found that the average performance of the 17 observers was significantly improved (p = 0.002) when aided by the CDSS-T. The cancer case difficulty, institution affiliation, specialty, and the assessment times influenced the observers' performance without CDSS-T. The AI-based decision support system has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy in assessing bladder cancer treatment response and result in more consistent performance among all physicians.;0
Development and Validation of the Nomograms for Predicting Overall Survival and Cancer-Specific Survival in Patients With Synovial Sarcoma.;BACKGROUND: The study aimed to build and validate practical nomograms to predict overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) for patients with synovial sarcoma (SyS). METHODS: A total of 893 eligible patients confirmed to have SyS between 2007 and 2015 were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Patients were randomly divided into the training cohort (n = 448) and validation cohort (n = 445). Clinically independent prognostic and important factors were determined according to the Akaike information criterion in multivariate Cox regression models when developing the nomograms with the training cohort. The predictive accuracy of nomograms was bootstrapped validated internally and externally with the concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to compare the clinical usefulness between nomograms and American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. RESULTS: Two nomograms shared common indicators including age, insurance status, tumor site, tumor size, SEER stage, surgery, and radiation, while marital status and tumor site were only included into the OS nomogram. The C-index of nomograms for predicting OS and CSS was 0.819 (0.873-0.764) and 0.821 (0.876-0.766), respectively, suggesting satisfactory predictive performance. Internal and external calibration curves exhibited optimal agreement between the nomogram prediction and the actual survival. Additionally, DCA demonstrated that our nomograms had obvious superiority over the AJCC staging system with more clinical net benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Two nomograms predicting 3- and 5-year OS and CSS of SyS patients were successfully constructed and validated for the first time, with higher predictive accuracy and clinical values than the AJCC staging system regarding OS and CSS.;0
Proposal and Evaluation of a Physician-Free, Real-Time On-Table Adaptive Radiotherapy (PF-ROAR) Workflow for the MRIdian MR-Guided LINAC.;With the implementation of MR-LINACs, real-time adaptive radiotherapy has become a possibility within the clinic. However, the process of adapting a patient's plan is time consuming and often requires input from the entire clinical team, which translates to decreased throughput and limited patient access. In this study, the authors propose and simulate a workflow to address these inefficiencies in staffing and patient throughput. Two physicians, three radiation therapists (RTT), and a research fellow each adapted bladder and bowel contours for 20 fractions from 10 representative patient plans. Contouring ability was compared via calculation of a Dice Similarity Index (DSI). The DSI for bladder and bowel based on each potential physician-therapist pair, as well as an inter-physician comparison, exhibited good overlap amongst all comparisons (p = 0.868). Plan quality was compared through calculation of the conformity index (CI), as well as an evaluation of the plan's dose to a 'gold standard' set of structures. Overall, non-physician plans passed 91.2% of the time. Of the eight non-physician plans that failed their clinical evaluation, six also failed their evaluation against the 'gold standard'. Another two plans that passed their clinical evaluation subsequently failed in their evaluation against the 'gold standard'. Thus, the PF-ROAR process has a success rate of 97.5%, with 78/80 plans correctly adapted to the gold standard or halted at treatment. These findings suggest that a physician-free workflow can be well tolerated provided RTTs continue to develop knowledge of MR anatomy and careful attention is given to understanding the complexity of the plan prior to treatment.;0
Pearls & Oy-sters: Pivoting Treatment Regimens of Pediatric Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumors to Optimize Care in Adult ATRT: A Case Report.;Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a highly malignant embryonal tumor of the CNS, largely affecting pediatric patients, with exceedingly rare cases in adults at an estimated annual incidence of 1/1,000,000. We report a unique case of ATRT in a 43-year-old female patient who first presented with progressive focal headaches. Imaging revealed a sellar mass with suprasellar extensions, which was partially removed via a transsphenoidal resection. The tumor aggressively recurred just 1 month postoperatively. Her care team pursued a novel treatment plan by using a slightly modified COG ACNS 0332 regimen, which involved radiation, followed by 4 cycles of monthly chemotherapy including vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and cisplatin. Hematopoietic stem cells were collected between radiation and chemotherapy in the event that the patient required stem cell salvage therapy postadjuvant chemotherapy. The MRIs taken at 2 and 4 months postrecurrence indicated a substantial decrease in tumor volume, with corresponding clinical improvements to cranial nerve deficits. Given the scarcity of literature on adult cases of ATRT and the lack of a standard of care for these cases, discussing the efficacy of our patient's treatment plan may aid clinical decision making for adult ATRT cases.;0
Improving appropriate imaging for non-specific low back pain.;Non-specific low back pain (LBP) is a common condition in the USA, with approximately 80% of adults who will have LBP at some point during their life and roughly 30% of the adult population suffering from LBP at any given time. Although LBP is the most common cause of disability in the USA, it often has no identifiable anatomic or physiologic cause. Many patients seeking care for non-specific LBP receive X-rays and other imaging studies. However, for most acute LBP patients, symptoms resolve within 4 weeks and the use of routine imaging may result in unnecessary radiation exposure and add unnecessary costs and wasted time for patients without contributing to patient outcomes. The specific aim of the quality improvement (QI) project was to determine the effect of a multicomponent intervention to enhance the appropriate imaging utilisation for acute LBP to >/=90%. During the first 6 months of the QI project, 191 patients with LBP were seen. Of those patients, 156 (81.7%) received appropriate imaging over the 6-month intervention period, missing our targeted goal. Furthermore, this rate declined to baseline values after termination of the intervention, suggesting the need for additional prompts to sustain the initial intervention effect. Following a health system-wide deployment of practice-based alerts and quality score cards, the appropriate utilisation rate increased again and quickly to the target rate of 90%. To reduce variability in our clinical practice and to sustain an appropriate utilisation rate will require continued work. Health systems must find efficient methods to reduce LBP imaging and increase appropriate management of non-specific LBP in primary care. Increasing concordance with imaging guidelines can lessen harm associated with unnecessary radiation exposure and result in significant cost savings.;0
Electronic self-reporting of adverse events for patients undergoing cancer treatment: the eRAPID research programme including two RCTs;"Background: Cancer is treated using multiple modalities (e.g. surgery, radiotherapy and systemic therapies) and is frequently associated with adverse events that affect treatment delivery and quality of life. Regular adverse event reporting could improve care and safety through timely detection and management. Information technology provides a feasible monitoring model, but applied research is needed. This research programme developed and evaluated an electronic system, called eRAPID, for cancer patients to remotely self-report adverse events. Objectives: The objectives were to address the following research questions: is it feasible to collect adverse event data from patients homes and in clinics during cancer treatment? Can eRAPID be implemented in different hospitals and treatment settings? Will oncology health-care professionals review eRAPID reports for decision-making? When added to usual care, will the eRAPID intervention (i.e. self-reporting with tailored advice) lead to clinical benefits (e.g. better adverse event control, improved patient safety and experiences)? Will eRAPID be cost-effective? Design: Five mixed-methods work packages were conducted, incorporating co-design with patients and health-care professionals: work package 1  development and implementation of the electronic platform across hospital centres; work package 2  development of patient-reported adverse event items and advice (systematic and scoping reviews, patient interviews, Delphi exercise); work package 3  mapping health-care professionals and care pathways; work package 4  feasibility pilot studies to assess patient and clinician acceptability; and work package 5  a single-centre randomised controlled trial of systemic treatment with a full health economic assessment. Setting: The setting was three UK cancer centres (in Leeds, Manchester and Bristol). Participants: The intervention was developed and evaluated with patients and clinicians. The systemic randomised controlled trial included 508 participants who were starting treatment for breast, colorectal or gynaecological cancer and 55 health-care professionals. The radiotherapy feasibility pilot recruited 167 patients undergoing treatment for pelvic cancers. The surgical feasibility pilot included 40 gastrointestinal cancer patients. Intervention: eRAPID is an online system that allows patients to complete adverse event/symptom reports from home or hospital. The system provides immediate severity-graded advice based on clinical algorithms to guide self-management or hospital contact. Adverse event data are transferred to electronic patient records for review by clinical teams. Patients complete an online symptom report every week and whenever they experience symptoms. Main outcome measures: In systemic treatment, the primary outcome was Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy  General, Physical Well-Being score assessed at 6, 12 and 18 weeks (primary end point). Secondary outcomes included cost-effectiveness assessed through the comparison of health-care costs and quality-adjusted life-years. Patient self-efficacy was measured (using the Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Diseases 6-item Scale). The radiotherapy pilot studied feasibility (recruitment and attrition rates) and selection of outcome measures. The surgical pilot examined symptom report completeness, system actions, barriers to using eRAPID and technical performance. Results: eRAPID was successfully developed and introduced across the treatments and centres. The systemic randomised controlled trial found no statistically significant effect of eRAPID on the primary end point at 18 weeks. There was a significant effect at 6 weeks (adjusted difference least square means 1.08, 95% confidence interval 0.12 to 2.05; p = 0.028) and 12 weeks (adjusted difference least square means 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 1.98; p = 0.0395). No between-arm differences were found for admissions or calls/visits to acute oncology or chemotherapy delivery. Health economic analyses over 18 weeks indicated no statistically significant difference between the cost of the eRAPID information technology system and the cost of usual care (12.28, 95% confidence interval 1240.91 to 1167.69; p > 0.05). Mean differences were small, with eRAPID having a 55% probability of being cost-effective at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence-recommended cost-effectiveness threshold of 20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Patient self-efficacy was greater in the intervention arm (0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.83; p = 0.0073). Qualitative interviews indicated that many participants found eRAPID useful for support and guidance. Patient adherence to adverse-event symptom reporting was good (median compliance 72.2%). In the radiotherapy pilot, high levels of consent (73.2%) and low attrition rates (10%) were observed. Patient quality-of-life outcomes indicated a potential intervention benefit in chemoradiotherapy arms. In the surgical pilot, 40 out of 91 approached patients (44%) consented. Symptom report completion rates were high. Across the studies, clinician intervention engagement was varied. Both patient and staff feedback on the value of eRAPID was positive. Limitations: The randomised controlled trial methodology led to small numbers of patients simultaneously using the intervention, thus reducing overall clinician exposure to and engagement with eRAPID. Furthermore, staff saw patients across both arms, introducing a contamination bias and potentially reducing the intervention effect. The health economic results were limited by numbers of missing data (e.g. for use of resources and EuroQol-5 Dimensions). Conclusions: This research provides evidence that online symptom monitoring with inbuilt patient advice is acceptable to patients and clinical teams. Evidence of patient benefit was found, particularly during the early phases of treatment and in relation to self-efficacy. The findings will help improve the intervention and guide future trial designs. Future work: Definitive trials in radiotherapy and surgical settings are suggested. Future research during systemic treatments could study self-report online interventions to replace elements of traditional follow-up care in the curative setting. Further research during modern targeted treatments (e.g. immunotherapy and small-molecule oral therapy) and in metastatic disease is recommended. Trial registration: The systemic randomised controlled trial is registered as ISRCTN88520246. The radiotherapy trial is registered as ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02747264.

Androgen deprivation therapy use and duration with definitive radiotherapy for localised prostate cancer: an individual patient data meta-analysis.;"BACKGROUND: Randomised trials have investigated various androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) intensification strategies in men receiving radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer. This individual patient data meta-analysis of relevant randomised trials aimed to quantify the benefit of these interventions in aggregate and in clinically relevant subgroups. METHODS: For this meta-analysis, we performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries, the Web of Science, Scopus, and conference proceedings to identify trials with results published in English between Jan 1, 1962, and Dec 30, 2020. Multicentre randomised trials were eligible if they evaluated the use or prolongation of ADT (or both) in men with localised prostate cancer receiving definitive radiotherapy, reported or collected distant metastasis and survival data, and used ADT for a protocol-defined finite duration. The Meta-Analysis of Randomized trials in Cancer of the Prostate (MARCAP) Consortium was accessed to obtain individual patient data from randomised trials. The primary outcome was metastasis-free survival. Hazard ratios (HRs) were obtained through stratified Cox models for ADT use (radiotherapy alone vs radiotherapy plus ADT), neoadjuvant ADT extension (ie, extension of total ADT duration in the neoadjuvant setting from 3-4 months to 6-9 months), and adjuvant ADT prolongation (ie, prolongation of total ADT duration in the adjuvant setting from 4-6 months to 18-36 months). Formal interaction tests between interventions and metastasis-free survival were done for prespecified subgroups defined by age, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, and radiotherapy dose. This meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021236855. FINDINGS: Our search returned 12 eligible trials that provided individual patient data (10 853 patients) with a median follow-up of 11.4 years (IQR 9.0-15.0). The addition of ADT to radiotherapy significantly improved metastasis-free survival (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.77-0.89], p<0.0001), as did adjuvant ADT prolongation (0.84 [0.78-0.91], p<0.0001), but neoadjuvant ADT extension did not (0.95 [0.83-1.09], p=0.50). Treatment effects were similar irrespective of radiotherapy dose, patient age, or NCCN risk group. INTERPRETATION: Our findings provide the strongest level of evidence so far to the magnitude of the benefit of ADT treatment intensification with radiotherapy for men with localised prostate cancer. Adding ADT and prolonging the portion of ADT that follows radiotherapy is associated with improved metastasis-free survival in men, regardless of risk group, age, and radiotherapy dose delivered; however, the magnitude of the benefit could vary and shared decision making with patients is recommended.

Normal Tissue Complication Probability Modelling for Toxicity Prediction and Patient Selection in Proton Beam Therapy to the Central Nervous System: A Literature Review.;"Normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models can guide clinical decision making in radiotherapy. In recent years, they have been used for patient selection for proton beam therapy (PBT) for some anatomical tumour sites. This review synthesizes the published evidence regarding the use of NTCP models to predict the toxicity of PBT, for different end points in patients with brain tumours. A search of Medline and Embase using the Patients, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) criteria was undertaken. In total, 37 articles were deemed relevant and were reviewed in detail. Nineteen articles on NTCP modelling of toxicity end points were included. Of these, 11 were comparative NTCP studies of PBT versus conventional photon radiotherapy (XRT), which evaluated differences in plan dosimetry and then assumed that XRT-derived literature estimates of NTCP would be applicable to both. Seven papers derived NTCP models based on PBT outcome data, two of which provided model parameters. Among analysed end points, the reduced risk of secondary tumours with PBT as compared with XRT is estimated - through modelling studies - to be considerable and was highlighted by most authors. For other analysed end points, the clinical benefit of PBT mainly depends on tumour location in relation to organs at risk as well as prescription doses. NTCP models can be useful tools for treatment plan comparison. However, most published toxicity data were derived from XRT cohorts; this review has highlighted the need for further studies relating dose-volume parameters to observed toxicity in PBT-treated patients. Specifically, there is a need for PBT-specific NTCP models that can be implemented in the clinical practice. NTCP models built on robust clinical data for the most common radiotherapy toxicities in the brain would potentially redefine the current indications for PBT.";0
Clinical and economic impact of molecular testing for BRAF fusion in pediatric low-grade Glioma.;"BACKGROUND: Treatment personalization via tumor molecular testing holds promise for improving outcomes for patients with pediatric low-grade glioma (PLGG). We evaluate the health economic impact of employing tumor molecular testing to guide treatment for patients diagnosed with PLGG, particularly the avoidance of radiation therapy (RT) for patients with BRAF-fusion. METHODS: We performed a model-based cost-utility analysis comparing two strategies: molecular testing to determine BRAF fusion status at diagnosis against no molecular testing. We developed a microsimulation to model the lifetime health and cost outcomes (in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 2018 CAD, respectively) for a simulated cohort of 100,000 patients newly diagnosed with PLGG after their initial surgery. RESULTS: The life expectancy after diagnosis for individuals who did not receive molecular testing was 39.01 (95% Confidence Intervals (CI): 32.94;44.38) years and 40.08 (95% CI: 33.19;45.76) years for those who received testing. Our findings indicate that patients who received molecular testing at diagnosis experienced a 0.38 (95% CI: 0.08;0.77) gain in QALYs and $1384 (95% CI: $-3486; $1204) reduction in costs over their lifetime. Cost and QALY benefits were driven primarily by the avoidance of long-term adverse events (stroke, secondary neoplasms) associated with unnecessary use of radiation. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of molecular testing in guiding the decision to provide RT in PLGG. While our results do not consider the impact of targeted therapies, this work is an example of the value of simulation modeling in assessing the long-term costs and benefits of precision oncology interventions for childhood cancer, which can aid decision-making about health system reimbursement.";0
[(177)Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE versus standard of care in adult patients with gastro-enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs): a cost-consequence analysis from an Italian hospital perspective.;"PURPOSE: To assess and compare clinical outcomes and costs, to the Italian healthcare system, of three therapeutic options approved in the management of adult patients with gastro-enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs). METHODS: We compared the efficacy, safety, and costs of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE, everolimus (both originator and generic products), and sunitinib in patients with advanced GEP-NETs (NET G1 and G2) that had progressed following treatment with somatostatin analogs (SSAs). A cost-consequence model was developed and validated by a panel of clinical experts from three NET reference centres in Italy. The clinical outcomes included in the model were median progression-free survival and the incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs), as reported in pivotal clinical trials. The costs for acquisition and administration of each treatment, and of managing AEs, were calculated from the perspective of the Italian national health service. Treatment costs per progression-free month were calculated separately for patients with NETs of pancreatic (PanNETs; all three treatments) and gastrointestinal (GI-NETs; [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE and everolimus only) origin. RESULTS: In patients with PanNETs, total costs per progression-free month were euro2989 for [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE, euro4975 for originator everolimus, euro3472 for generic everolimus, and euro5337 for sunitinib. In patients with GI-NETs, total costs per progression-free month were euro3189 for [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE, euro4990 for originator everolimus, and euro3483 for generic everolimus. CONCLUSIONS: [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE was associated with lower costs per progression-free month versus relevant treatment options in patients with GI-NETs or PanNETs (NET G1-G2; progressed following SSA treatment), although acquisition and administration costs are higher. These findings provide further economic arguments in the overall context of treatment decision-making.";0
(64)Cu-ATSM Predicts Efficacy of Carbon Ion Radiotherapy Associated with Cellular Antioxidant Capacity.;"Carbon ion radiotherapy is an emerging cancer treatment modality that has a greater therapeutic window than conventional photon radiotherapy. To maximize the efficacy of this extremely scarce medical resource, it is important to identify predictive biomarkers of higher carbon ion relative biological effectiveness (RBE) over photons. We addressed this issue by focusing on cellular antioxidant capacity and investigated (64)Cu(II)-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) ((64)Cu-ATSM), a potential radioligand that reflects an over-reduced intracellular environment. We found that the carbon ion RBE correlated with (64)Cu-ATSM uptake both in vitro and in vivo. High RBE/(64)Cu-ATSM cells showed greater steady-state levels of antioxidant proteins and increased capacity to scavenge reactive oxygen species in response to X-rays than low RBE/(64)Cu-ATSM counterparts; this upregulation of antioxidant systems was associated with downregulation of TCA cycle intermediates. Furthermore, inhibition of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) sensitized high RBE/(64)Cu-ATSM cells to X-rays, thereby reducing RBE values to levels comparable to those in low RBE/(64)Cu-ATSM cells. These data suggest that the cellular activity of Nrf2-driven antioxidant systems is a possible determinant of carbon ion RBE predictable by (64)Cu-ATSM uptake. These new findings highlight the potential clinical utility of (64)Cu-ATSM imaging to identify high RBE tumors that will benefit from carbon ion radiotherapy.";0
Comparison of Guidelines for Evaluation of Suspected Pulmonary Embolism in Pregnancy: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis.;BACKGROUND: Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a leading cause of maternal mortality, yet diagnosis remains challenging. International diagnostic guidelines vary significantly in their recommendations, making it difficult to determine an optimal policy for evaluation. RESEARCH QUESTION: Which societal-level diagnostic guidelines for evaluation of suspected PE in pregnancy are an optimal policy in terms of its cost-effectiveness? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We constructed a complex Markov decision model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each identified societal guidelines for diagnosis of PE in pregnancy. Our model accounted for risk stratification, empiric treatment, diagnostic testing strategies, as well as short- and long-term effects from PE, treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin, and radiation exposure from advanced imaging. We considered clinical and cost outcomes of each guideline from a US health care system perspective with a lifetime horizon. Clinical effectiveness and costs were measured in time-discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and US dollars, respectively. Strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. One-way, multiway, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: We identified six international societal-level guidelines. Base-case analysis showed the guideline proposed by the American Thoracic Society and Society of Thoracic Radiology (ATS-STR) yielded the highest health benefits (22.90 QALYs) and was cost-effective, with an ICER of $7,808 over the guidelines proposed by the Australian Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis and the Society of Obstetric Medicine of Australia and New Zealand (ASTH-SOMANZ). All remaining guidelines were dominated. The ATS-STR guideline-recommended strategy yielded an expected additional 2.7 QALYs/100 patients evaluated over the ASTH-SOMANZ. Conclusions were robust to sensitivity analyses, with the ATS-STR guidelines optimal in 86% of probabilistic sensitivity analysis scenarios. INTERPRETATION: The ATS-STR guidelines for diagnosis of suspected PE in pregnancy are cost-effective and generate better expected health outcomes than guidelines proposed by other medical societies.;0
Performance of a Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography-Derived Risk-Stratification Tool for High-risk and Very High-risk Prostate Cancer.;"IMPORTANCE: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) can detect low-volume, nonlocalized (ie, regional or metastatic) prostate cancer that was occult on conventional imaging. However, the long-term clinical implications of PSMA PET/CT upstaging remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prognostic significance of a nomogram that models an individual's risk of nonlocalized upstaging on PSMA PET/CT and to compare its performance with existing risk-stratification tools. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included patients diagnosed with high-risk or very high-risk prostate cancer (ie, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level >20 ng/mL, Gleason score 8-10, and/or clinical stage T3-T4, without evidence of nodal or metastatic disease by conventional workup) from April 1995 to August 2018. This multinational study was conducted at 15 centers. Data were analyzed from December 2020 to March 2021. EXPOSURES: Curative-intent radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), or EBRT plus brachytherapy (BT), with or without androgen deprivation therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: PSMA upstage probability was calculated from a nomogram using the biopsy Gleason score, percentage positive systematic biopsy cores, clinical T category, and PSA level. Biochemical recurrence (BCR), distant metastasis (DM), prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using Fine-Gray and Cox regressions. Model performance was quantified with the concordance (C) index. RESULTS: Of 5275 patients, the median (IQR) age was 66 (60-72) years; 2883 (55%) were treated with RP, 1669 (32%) with EBRT, and 723 (14%) with EBRT plus BT; median (IQR) PSA level was 10.5 (5.9-23.2) ng/mL; 3987 (76%) had Gleason grade 8 to 10 disease; and 750 (14%) had stage T3 to T4 disease. Median (IQR) follow-up was 5.1 (3.1-7.9) years; 1221 (23%) were followed up for at least 8 years. Overall, 1895 (36%) had BCR, 851 (16%) developed DM, and 242 (5%) died of prostate cancer. PSMA upstage probability was significantly prognostic of all clinical end points, with 8-year C indices of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.61-0.65) for BCR, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.66-0.71) for DM, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.67-0.75) for PCSM, and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.57-0.62) for PCSM (P < .001). The PSMA nomogram outperformed existing risk-stratification tools, except for similar performance to Staging Collaboration for Cancer of the Prostate (STAR-CAP) for PCSM (eg, DM: PSMA, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.66-0.71] vs STAR-CAP, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.62-0.68]; P < .001; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.54-0.60]; P < .001; Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment groups, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.51-0.56]; P < .001). Results were validated in secondary cohorts from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and the National Cancer Database. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that PSMA upstage probability is associated with long-term, clinically meaningful end points. Furthermore, PSMA upstaging had superior risk discrimination compared with existing tools. Formerly occult, PSMA PET/CT-detectable nonlocalized disease may be the main driver of outcomes in high-risk patients.";0
Clinical Outcomes of RTOG 9310 Protocol for Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma: Single-Center Experience with 87 Patients.;"The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9310 protocol clinical trial established high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) as the standard for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). We aimed to investigate the RTOG 9310 protocol's PCNSL outcomes by examining progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates and determining the influential factors. Between 2007 and 2020, 87 patients were histopathologically diagnosed with PCNSL and treated with the RTOG 9310 protocol. All received HDMTX 2.5 g/m(2) and vincristine 1.4 mg/m(2)/day for 1 day during weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, and procarbazine 100 mg/m(2)/day for 1 day during weeks 1, 5, and 9. Dexamethasone was administered on a standard tapering schedule from the first week to the sixth week. Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), consisting of 45 Gy for patients with less than a complete response to the chemotherapy or 36 Gy for complete responders, was started 1 week after the last dose of chemotherapy was administered. Within three weeks of the completion of WBRT, patients received two courses of cytarabine, which were separated by 3-4 weeks. Clinical, radiological, and histopathological characteristics were retrospectively reviewed. All patients completed five HDMTX cycles and a mean follow-up of 60.2 (range, 6-150) months. Twenty-eight (32.2%) patients experienced recurrence during follow-up. The mean time to recurrence was 21.8 months, while the mean PFS was 104.3 (95% confidence interval (CI), 90.6-118.0) months. Eleven (12.6%) patients died; the mean OS was 132.1 (95% CI, 122.2-141.9) months. The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 92.0% and 87.4%, respectively. One patient experienced acute renal failure, while the remainder tolerated any cytotoxic side effects. On multivariate analysis, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score </= 2; the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group low-risk status; XBP-1, p53, and c-Myc negativity; homogenous enhancement; gross total resection, independently correlated with long PFS and OS. The RTOG 9310 protocol is effective for PCNSL and features good outcomes.";0
Artificial intelligence applications in intensity modulated radiation treatment planning: an overview.;Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to methods that improve and automate challenging human tasks by systematically capturing and applying relevant knowledge in these tasks. Over the past decades, a number of approaches have been developed to address different types and needs of system intelligence ranging from search strategies to knowledge representation and inference to robotic planning. In the context of radiation treatment planning, multiple AI approaches may be adopted to improve the planning quality and efficiency. For example, knowledge representation and inference methods may improve dose prescription by integrating and reasoning about the domain knowledge described in many clinical guidelines and clinical trials reports. In this review, we will focus on the most studied AI approach in intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)/volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)-machine learning (ML) and describe our recent efforts in applying ML to improve the quality, consistency, and efficiency of IMRT/VMAT planning. With the available high-quality data, we can build models to accurately predict critical variables for each step of the planning process and thus automate and improve its outcomes. Specific to the IMRT/VMAT planning process, we can build models for each of the four critical components in the process: dose-volume histogram (DVH), Dose, Fluence, and Human Planner. These models can be divided into two general groups. The first group focuses on encoding prior experience and knowledge through ML and more recently deep learning (DL) from prior clinical plans and using these models to predict the optimal DVH (DVH prediction model), or 3D dose distribution (dose prediction model), or fluence map (fluence map model). The goal of these models is to reduce or remove the trial-and-error process and guarantee consistently high-quality plans. The second group of models focuses on mimicking human planners' decision-making process (planning strategy model) during the iterative adjustments/guidance of the optimization engine. Each critical step of the IMRT/VMAT treatment planning process can be improved and automated by AI methods. As more training data becomes available and more sophisticated models are developed, we can expect that the AI methods in treatment planning will continue to improve accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.;0
A data-driven approach to optimal beam/arc angle selection for liver stereotactic body radiation therapy treatment planning.;BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for liver cancer has shown promising therapeutic effects. Effective treatment relies not only on the precise delivery provided by image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) but also high dose gradient formed around the treatment volume to spare functional liver tissue, which is highly dependent on the beam/arc angle selection. In this study, we aim to develop a decision support model to learn human planner's beam navigation approach for beam angle/arc angle selection for liver SBRT. METHODS: A total of 27 liver SBRT/HIGRT patients (10 IMRT, 17 VMAT/DCA) were included in this study. A dosimetric budget index was defined for each beam angle/control point considering dose penetration through the patient body and liver tissue. Optimal beam angle setting (beam angles for IMRT and start/terminal angle for VMAT/DCA) was determined by minimizing the loss function defined as the sum of total dosimetric budget index and beam span penalty function. Leave-one-out validation was exercised on all 27 cases while weighting coefficients in the loss function was tuned in nested cross validation. To compare the efficacy of the model, a model plan was generated using automatically generated beam setting while retaining the original optimization constraints in the clinical plan. Model plan was normalized to the same planning target volume (PTV) V100% as the clinical plans. Dosimetric endpoints including PTV D98%, D2%, liver V20Gy and total MU were compared between two plan groups. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was performed with the null hypothesis being that no difference exists between two plan groups. RESULTS: Beam setting prediction was instantaneous. Mean PTV D98% was 91.3% and 91.3% (P=0.566), while mean PTV D2% was 107.9% and 108.1% (P=0.164) for clinical plan and model plan respectively. Liver V20Gy showed no significant difference (P=0.590) with 23.3% for clinical plan and 23.4% for the model plan. Total MU is comparable (P=0.256) between the clinical plan (avg. 2,389.6) and model plan (avg. 2,319.6). CONCLUSIONS: The evidence driven beam setting model yielded similar plan quality as hand-crafted clinical plan. It is capable of capturing human's knowledge in beam selection decision making. This model could facilitate decision making for beam angle selection while eliminating lengthy trial-and-error process of adjusting beam setting during liver SBRT treatment planning.;0
Early prediction of clinical response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy in human solid tumors through mathematical modeling.;BACKGROUND: Checkpoint inhibitor therapy of cancer has led to markedly improved survival of a subset of patients in multiple solid malignant tumor types, yet the factors driving these clinical responses or lack thereof are not known. We have developed a mechanistic mathematical model for better understanding these factors and their relations in order to predict treatment outcome and optimize personal treatment strategies. METHODS: Here, we present a translational mathematical model dependent on three key parameters for describing efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors in human cancer: tumor growth rate (alpha), tumor-immune infiltration (Lambda), and immunotherapy-mediated amplification of anti-tumor response (micro). The model was calibrated by fitting it to a compiled clinical tumor response dataset (n = 189 patients) obtained from published anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 clinical trials, and then validated on an additional validation cohort (n = 64 patients) obtained from our in-house clinical trials. RESULTS: The derived parameters Lambda and micro were both significantly different between responding versus nonresponding patients. Of note, our model appropriately classified response in 81.4% of patients by using only tumor volume measurements and within 2 months of treatment initiation in a retrospective analysis. The model reliably predicted clinical response to the PD-1/PD-L1 class of checkpoint inhibitors across multiple solid malignant tumor types. Comparison of model parameters to immunohistochemical measurement of PD-L1 and CD8+ T cells confirmed robust relationships between model parameters and their underlying biology. CONCLUSIONS: These results have demonstrated reliable methods to inform model parameters directly from biopsy samples, which are conveniently obtainable as early as the start of treatment. Together, these suggest that the model parameters may serve as early and robust biomarkers of the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor therapy on an individualized per-patient basis.

Development and Assessment of a Clinical Calculator for Estimating the Likelihood of Recurrence and Survival Among Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Treated With Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy, and Surgery.;"IMPORTANCE: Predicting outcomes in patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer is challenging because of tumor downstaging. Validated clinical calculators that can estimate recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) among patients with rectal cancer who have received multimodal therapy are needed. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate clinical calculators providing estimates of rectal cancer recurrence and survival that are better for individualized decision-making than the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system or the neoadjuvant rectal (NAR) score. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study developed risk models, graphically represented as nomograms, for patients with incomplete pathological response using Cox proportional hazards and multivariable regression analyses with restricted cubic splines. Because patients with complete pathological response to neoadjuvant therapy had uniformly favorable outcomes, their predictions were obtained separately. The study included 1400 patients with stage II or III rectal cancer who received treatment with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery at 2 comprehensive cancer centers (Memorial Sloan Kettering [MSK] Cancer Center and Siteman Cancer Center [SCC]) between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2017. Patients from the MSK cohort received chemoradiation, surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2014; these patients were randomly assigned to either a model training group or an internal validation group. Models were externally validated using data from the SCC cohort, who received either chemoradiation, surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy (chemoradiotherapy group) or short-course radiotherapy, consolidation chemotherapy, and surgery (total neoadjuvant therapy with short-course radiotherapy group) from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2017. Data were analyzed from March 1, 2020, to January 10, 2021. EXPOSURES: Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, and surgery. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Recurrence-free survival and OS were the outcome measures, and the discriminatory performance of the clinical calculators was measured with concordance index and calibration plots. The ability of the clinical calculators to predict RFS and OS was compared with that of the AJCC staging system and the NAR score. The models for RFS and OS among patients with incomplete pathological response included postoperative pathological tumor category, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor distance from anal verge, and large- and small-vessel venous and perineural invasion; age was included in the risk model for OS. The final clinical calculators provided RFS and OS estimates derived from Kaplan-Meier curves for patients with complete pathological response and from risk models for patients with incomplete pathological response. RESULTS: Among 1400 total patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, the median age was 57.8 years (range, 18.0-91.9 years), and 863 patients (61.6%) were male, with tumors at a median distance of 6.7 cm (range, 0-15.0 cm) from the anal verge. The MSK cohort comprised 1069 patients; of those, 710 were assigned to the model training group and 359 were assigned to the internal validation group. The SCC cohort comprised 331 patients; of those, 200 were assigned to the chemoradiotherapy group and 131 were assigned to the total neoadjuvant therapy with short-course radiotherapy group. The concordance indices in the MSK validation data set were 0.70 (95% CI, 0.65-0.76) for RFS and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.65-0.80) for OS. In the external SCC data set, the concordance indices in the chemoradiotherapy group were 0.71 (95% CI, 0.62-0.81) for RFS and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.59-0.85) for OS; the concordance indices in the total neoadjuvant therapy with short-course radiotherapy group were 0.62 (95% CI, 0.49-0.75) for RFS and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.46-0.84) for OS. Calibration plots confirmed good agreement between predicted and observed events. These results compared favorably with predictions based on the AJCC staging system (concordance indices for MSK validation: RFS = 0.69 [95% CI, 0.64-0.74]; OS = 0.67 [95% CI, 0.58-0.75]) and the NAR score (concordance indices for MSK validation: RFS = 0.56 [95% CI, 0.50-0.63]; OS = 0.56 [95% CI, 0.46-0.66]). Furthermore, the clinical calculators provided more individualized outcome estimates compared with the categorical schemas (eg, estimated RFS for patients with AJCC stage IIIB disease ranged from 7% to 68%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this prognostic study, clinical calculators were developed and validated; these calculators provided more individualized estimates of the likelihood of RFS and OS than the AJCC staging system or the NAR score among patients with rectal cancer who received multimodal treatment. The calculators were easy to use and applicable to both short- and long-course radiotherapy regimens, and they may be used to inform surveillance strategies and facilitate future clinical trials and statistical power calculations.";0
Improved prediction of immune checkpoint blockade efficacy across multiple cancer types.;Only a fraction of patients with cancer respond to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment, but current decision-making procedures have limited accuracy. In this study, we developed a machine learning model to predict ICB response by integrating genomic, molecular, demographic and clinical data from a comprehensively curated cohort (MSK-IMPACT) with 1,479 patients treated with ICB across 16 different cancer types. In a retrospective analysis, the model achieved high sensitivity and specificity in predicting clinical response to immunotherapy and predicted both overall survival and progression-free survival in the test data across different cancer types. Our model significantly outperformed predictions based on tumor mutational burden, which was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this purpose(1). Additionally, the model provides quantitative assessments of the model features that are most salient for the predictions. We anticipate that this approach will substantially improve clinical decision-making in immunotherapy and inform future interventions.;0
Development of a patient decision aid for patients with breast cancer who consider immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy.;"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to develop a patient decision aid (pDA) that could support patients with breast cancer (BC) in making an informed decision about breast reconstruction (BR) after mastectomy. METHODS: The development included four stages: (i) Establishment of a multidisciplinary team; (ii) Needs assessment consisting of semi-structured interviews in patients and a survey among healthcare professionals (HCPs); (iii) Creation of content, design and technical system; and (iv) Acceptability and usability testing using a think-aloud approach in patients and interviews among HCPs and representatives of the Dutch Breast Cancer Patient Organization. RESULTS: From the needs assessment, three themes were identified: Challenging period to make a decision, Diverse motivations for a personal decision and Information needed to make a decision about BR. HCPs valued the development of a pDA, especially to prepare patients for consultation. The pDA that was developed contained three parts: first, a consultation sheet for oncological breast surgeons to introduce the choice; second, an online tool including an overview of reconstructive options, the pros and cons of each option, information on the consequences of each option for daily life, exercises to clarify personal values and patient stories; and third, a summary sheet with patients' values, preferences and questions to help inform and guide the discussion between the patient and her plastic surgeon. The pDA was perceived to be informative, helpful and easy to use by patients and HCPs. CONCLUSION: Consistent with information needs, a pDA was developed to support patients with BC who consider immediate BR in making an informed decision together with their plastic surgeon. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Patients participated in the needs assessment and in acceptability and usability testing.";0
PROTECT: Prospective Phase-II-Trial Evaluating Adaptive Proton Therapy for Cervical Cancer to Reduce the Impact on Morbidity and the Immune System.;External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with concurrent chemotherapy followed by brachytherapy is a very effective treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). However, treatment-related toxicity is common and reduces the patient's quality of life (QoL) and ability to complete treatment or undergo adjuvant therapies. Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) enables a significant dose reduction in organs at risk (OAR), when compared to that of standard intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). However, clinical studies evaluating whether IMPT consequently reduces side effects for LACC are lacking. The PROTECT trial is a nonrandomized prospective multicenter phase-II-trial comparing clinical outcomes after IMPT or IMRT/VMAT in LACC. Thirty women aged >18 years with a histological diagnosis of LACC will be included in either the IMPT or IMRT/VMAT group. Treatment includes EBRT (45 Gy in 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy), concurrent five weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m(2)), and 3D image (MRI)-guided adaptive brachytherapy. The primary endpoint is pelvic bones D(mean) and mean bowel V(15Gy). Secondary endpoints include dosimetric parameters, oncological outcomes, health-related QoL, immune response, safety, and tolerability. This study provides the first data on the potential of IMPT to reduce OAR dose in clinical practice and improve toxicity and QoL for patients with LACC.;0
Machine learning for dose-volume histogram based clinical decision-making support system in radiation therapy plans for brain tumors.;PURPOSE: To create and investigate a novel, clinical decision-support system using machine learning (ML). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The ML model was developed based on 79 radiotherapy plans of brain tumor patients that were prescribed a total dose of 60 Gy delivered with volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Structures considered for analysis included planning target volume (PTV), brainstem, cochleae, and optic chiasm. The model aimed to classify the target variable that included class-0 corresponding to plans for which the PTV treatment planning objective was met and class-1 that was associated with plans for which the PTV objective was not met due to the priority trade-off to meet one or more organs-at-risk constraints. Several models were evaluated using double-nested cross-validation and an area-under-the-curve (AUC) metric, with the highest performing one selected for further investigation. The model predictions were explained with Shapely additive explanation (SHAP) interaction values. RESULTS: The highest-performing model was Logistic Regression achieving an accuracy of 93.8 +/- 4.1% and AUC of 0.98 +/- 0.02 on the testing data. The SHAP analysis indicated that the DeltaD(99%) metric for PTV had the greatest influence on the model predictions. The least important feature was DeltaD(MAX) for the left and right cochleae. CONCLUSIONS: The trained model achieved satisfactory accuracy and can be used by medical physicists in a data-driven quality assurance program as well as by radiation oncologists to support their decision-making process in terms of treatment plan approval and potential plan modifications. Model explanation analysis showed that the model relies on clinically valid logic when making predictions.;0
Circulating Tumour Cell Numbers Correlate with Platelet Count and Circulating Lymphocyte Subsets in Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer: Data from the ExPeCT Clinical Trial (CTRIAL-IE 15-21).;Interactions between circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and platelets are thought to inhibit natural killer(NK)-cell-induced lysis. We attempted to correlate CTC numbers in men with advanced prostate cancer with platelet counts and circulating lymphocyte numbers. Sixty-one ExPeCT trial participants, divided into overweight/obese and normal weight groups on the basis of a BMI >/= 25 or <25, were randomized to participate or not in a six-month exercise programme. Blood samples at randomization, and at three and six months, were subjected to ScreenCell filtration, circulating platelet counts were obtained, and flow cytometry was performed on a subset of samples (n = 29). CTC count positively correlated with absolute total lymphocyte count (r(2) = 0.1709, p = 0.0258) and NK-cell count (r(2) = 0.49, p < 0.0001). There was also a positive correlation between platelet count and CTC count (r(2) = 0.094, p = 0.0001). Correlation was also demonstrated within the overweight/obese group (n = 123, p < 0.0001), the non-exercise group (n = 79, p = 0.001) and blood draw samples lacking platelet cloaking (n = 128, p < 0.0001). By flow cytometry, blood samples from the exercise group (n = 15) had a higher proportion of CD3+ T-lymphocytes (p = 0.0003) and lower proportions of B-lymphocytes (p = 0.0264) and NK-cells (p = 0.015) than the non-exercise group (n = 14). These findings suggest that CTCs engage in complex interactions with the coagulation cascade and innate immune system during intravascular transit, and they present an attractive target for directed therapy at a vulnerable stage in metastasis.;0
Machine-learning algorithm to predict multidisciplinary team treatment recommendations in the management of basal cell carcinoma.;BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common human cancer. Facial BCCs most commonly occur on the nose and the management of these lesions is particularly complex, given the functional and complex implications of treatment. Multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings are routinely held to integrate expertise from dermatologists, surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, pathologists and allied health professionals. The aim of this research was to develop a supervised machine-learning algorithm to predict MDT recommendations for nasal BCC to potentially reduce MDT caseload, provide automatic decision support and permit data audit in a health service context. METHODS: The study population included all consecutive patients who were discussed at skin cancer-specialised MDT (SSMDT) with a diagnosis of nasal BCC between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015. We conducted analyses for gender, age, anatomical location, histological subtype, tumour size, tumour recurrence, anticoagulation, pacemaker, immunosuppressants and therapeutic modalities (Mohs surgery, conventional excision or radiotherapy). We used S-statistic computing language to develop a supervised machine-learning algorithm. RESULTS: We found that 37.5% of patients could be reliably predicted to be triaged to Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), based on tumour location and age. Similarly, the choice of conventional treatment (surgical excision or radiotherapy) by the MDT could be reliably predicted based on the patient's age, tumour phenotype and lesion size. Accordingly, the algorithm reliably predicted the MDT decision outcome of 45.1% of nasal BCCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the machine-learning approach is a potentially useful tool for predicting MDT decisions for MMS vs conventional surgery or radiotherapy for a significant group of patients. We suggest that utilising this algorithm gives the MDT more time to consider more complex patients, where multiple factors, including recurrence, financial costs and cosmetic outcome, contribute to the final decision, but cannot be reliably predicted to determine that outcome. This approach has the potential to reduce the burden and improve the efficiency of the specialist skin MDT and, in turn, improve patient care, reduce waiting times and reduce the financial burden. Such an algorithm would need to be updated regularly to take into account any changes in patient referral patterns, treatment options or local clinical expertise.

Endocrine Surgical Procedures During COVID-19: Patient Prioritization and Time to Surgery.;"BACKGROUND: We tracked endocrine surgery patients with treatment delays due to COVID-19 to investigate the relationship between physician assigned priority scoring (PAPS), the Medically Necessary, Time Sensitive (MeNTS) scoring system and delay to surgery. MATERIAL & METHODS: Patients scheduled for endocrine surgery or clinically evaluated during COVID-19-related elective surgery hold at our institution (2/26/20-5/1/20) were prospectively enrolled. PAPS was assigned based on categories of high, moderate, or low risk, consistent with the American College of Surgeons' priority system. MeNTS scores were calculated. The primary outcome was delay to surgery. Descriptive statistics were performed, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated for PAPS and MeNTS. RESULTS: Of 146 patients included, 68% (n = 100) were female; the median age was 60 years (IQR:43,67). Mean delay to surgery was significantly shorter (P = 0.01) in patients with high PAPS (35 d), compared with moderate (61 d) and low (79 d) PAPS groups. MeNTS scores were provided for 105 patients and were analyzed by diagnosis. Patients with benign thyroid disease (n = 17) had a significantly higher MeNTS score than patients with thyroid disease which was malignant/suspicious for malignancy (n = 44) patients (51.5 versus 47.6, P = 0.034). Higher PAPS correlated well with a delay to surgery of <30 d (AUC: 0.72). MeNTS score did not correlate well with delay to surgery <30 d (AUC: 0.52). CONCLUSION: PAPS better predicted delay to surgery than MeNTS scores. PAPS may incorporate more complex components of clinical decision-making which are not captured in the MeNTS score.";0
Exosomes from primed MSCs can educate monocytes as a cellular therapy for hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome.;BACKGROUND: Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) is caused by acute exposure to ionizing radiation that damages multiple organ systems but especially the bone marrow (BM). We have previously shown that human macrophages educated with exosomes from human BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) prolonged survival in a xenogeneic lethal ARS model. The purpose of this study was to determine if exosomes from LPS-primed MSCs could directly educate human monocytes (LPS-EEMos) for the treatment of ARS. METHODS: Human monocytes were educated by exosomes from LPS-primed MSCs and compared to monocytes educated by unprimed MSCs (EEMos) and uneducated monocytes to assess survival and clinical improvement in a xenogeneic mouse model of ARS. Changes in surface molecule expression of exosomes and monocytes after education were determined by flow cytometry, while gene expression was determined by qPCR. Irradiated human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were co-cultured with LPS-EEMos, EEMos, or uneducated monocytes to assess effects on HSC survival and proliferation. RESULTS: LPS priming of MSCs led to the production of exosomes with increased expression of CD9, CD29, CD44, CD146, and MCSP. LPS-EEMos showed increases in gene expression of IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, IDO, and FGF-2 as compared to EEMos generated from unprimed MSCs. Generation of LPS-EEMos induced a lower percentage of CD14(+) monocyte subsets that were CD16(+), CD73(+), CD86(+), or CD206(+) but a higher percentage of PD-L1(+) cells. LPS-EEMos infused 4 h after lethal irradiation significantly prolonged survival, reducing clinical scores and weight loss as compared to controls. Complete blood counts from LPS-EEMo-treated mice showed enhanced hematopoietic recovery post-nadir. IL-6 receptor blockade completely abrogated the radioprotective survival benefit of LPS-EEMos in vivo in female NSG mice, but only loss of hematopoietic recovery was noted in male NSG mice. PD-1 blockade had no effect on survival. Furthermore, LPS-EEMos also showed benefits in vivo when administered 24 h, but not 48 h, after lethal irradiation. Co-culture of unprimed EEMos or LPS-EEMos with irradiated human CD34+ HSCs led to increased CD34+ proliferation and survival, suggesting hematopoietic recovery may be seen clinically. CONCLUSION: LPS-EEMos are a potential counter-measure for hematopoietic ARS, with a reduced biomanufacturing time that facilitates hematopoiesis.;0
Granular Cell Tumor of the Orbit: Review of the Literature and a Proposed Treatment Modality.;PURPOSE: To document a unique case of granular cell tumor of the orbit, located lateral to and abutting the optic nerve, that benefited from treatment with proton beam irradiation, with a comprehensive review of the literature on granular cell tumor of the orbit. METHODS: Clinicopathologic case report with detailed imaging features and histopathologic and immunohistochemical evaluation for cytoplasmic tumor biomarkers differentiating granular cell tumor (GCT) from it mimicking lesions with relevant literature citations. The authors reviewed 20 cases of orbital GCT from 2011 to 2020 in addition to 40 cases from 1948 to 2011 and included a summary of imaging and clinical features, outcomes, and recommended treatment modalities. RESULTS: A 32-year-old man with 1-year history of left retrobulbar pain and diplopia on lateral gaze, intermittent left eyelid swelling, and a tonic left pupil was found to have a fusiform intraconal mass extending toward the orbital apex and abutting the optic nerve. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical investigations collectively supplied data diagnostic of a GCT with an initial low proliferation rate. GCT is a soft tissue neoplasm that originates in the nervous system and can occur anywhere in the body. This enhancing tumor is isointense to gray matter on T1-weighted MRI, hypointense on T2. After an incisional biopsy, the patient's symptoms persisted, and follow-up imaging several months later revealed further growth of the mass. The impossibility of complete surgical removal prompted the decision to treat with proton beam radiation therapy, which resulted in substantial regression in the size of the residual tumor. Most frequently involving the inferior rectus muscle (42%), orbital GCT is usually benign with only 4 reported cases of malignant orbital GCT (7%). Wide surgical resection with complete removal is usually curative for benign orbital GCT, and proton beam radiation therapy can aid in tumor shrinkage. CONCLUSIONS: GCT should be considered in the differential diagnosis when encountering patients with mass lesions involving the extraocular muscles, peripheral nerves, or less frequently, the optic nerve or orbital apex. Immunohistochemical analysis of biopsied tissue is required for the definitive diagnosis of GCT. Consideration of adjuvant therapies such as proton beam radiation therapy may be appropriate in cases of incomplete surgical resection of benign GCT. Proton beam radiation therapy can be an excellent therapeutic option for symptomatic relief and residual tumor size reduction with an acceptable toxicity profile.;0
Predicted Risks of Cardiovascular Disease Following Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy in the UK NCRI RAPID Trial of Positron Emission Tomography-Directed Therapy for Early-Stage Hodgkin Lymphoma.;"PURPOSE: The contemporary management of early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (ES-HL) involves balancing the risk of late adverse effects of radiotherapy against the increased risk of relapse if radiotherapy is omitted. This study provides information on the risk of radiation-related cardiovascular disease to help personalize the delivery of radiotherapy in ES-HL. METHODS: We predicted 30-year absolute cardiovascular risk from chemotherapy and involved field radiotherapy in patients who were positron emission tomography (PET)-negative following three cycles of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine chemotherapy within a UK randomized trial of PET-directed therapy for ES-HL. Cardiac and carotid radiation doses and chemotherapy exposure were combined with established dose-response relationships and population-based mortality and incidence rates. RESULTS: Average mean heart dose was 4.0 Gy (range 0.1-24.0 Gy) and average bilateral common carotid artery dose was 21.5 Gy (range 0.6-38.1 Gy), based on individualized cardiovascular dosimetry for 144 PET-negative patients receiving involved field radiotherapy. The average predicted 30-year radiation-related absolute excess overall cardiovascular mortality was 0.56% (range 0.01%-6.79%; < 0.5% in 67% of patients and > 1% in 15%), whereas average predicted 30-year excess incidence was 6.24% (range 0.31%-31.09%; < 5% in 58% of patients and > 10% in 24%). For cardiac disease, the average predicted 30-year radiation-related absolute excess mortality was 0.42% (0.79% with mediastinal involvement and 0.05% without) and for stroke, it was 0.14%. CONCLUSION: Predicted excess cardiovascular risk is small for most patients, so radiotherapy may provide net benefit. However, for a minority of patients receiving high doses of radiation to cardiovascular structures, it may be preferable to consider advanced radiotherapy techniques to reduce doses or to omit radiotherapy and accept the increased relapse risk. Individual assessment of cardiovascular and other risks before treatment would allow personalized decision making about radiotherapy in ES-HL.";0
Implementation of the Australian Computer-Assisted Theragnostics (AusCAT) network for radiation oncology data extraction, reporting and distributed learning.;INTRODUCTION: There is significant potential to analyse and model routinely collected data for radiotherapy patients to provide evidence to support clinical decisions, particularly where clinical trials evidence is limited or non-existent. However, in practice there are administrative, ethical, technical, logistical and legislative barriers to having coordinated data analysis platforms across radiation oncology centres. METHODS: A distributed learning network of computer systems is presented, with software tools to extract and report on oncology data and to enable statistical model development. A distributed or federated learning approach keeps data in the local centre, but models are developed from the entire cohort. RESULTS: The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated across six Australian oncology centres, using routinely collected lung cancer data from oncology information systems. The infrastructure was used to validate and develop machine learning for model-based clinical decision support and for one centre to assess patient eligibility criteria for two major lung cancer radiotherapy clinical trials (RTOG-9410, RTOG-0617). External validation of a 2-year overall survival model for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) gave an AUC of 0.65 and C-index of 0.62 across the network. For one centre, 65% of Stage III NSCLC patients did not meet eligibility criteria for either of the two practice-changing clinical trials, and these patients had poorer survival than eligible patients (10.6 m vs. 15.8 m, P = 0.024). CONCLUSION: Population-based studies on routine data are possible using a distributed learning approach. This has the potential for decision support models for patients for whom supporting clinical trial evidence is not applicable.;0
Characterizing intra-tumor regions on quantitative ultrasound parametric images to predict breast cancer response to chemotherapy at pre-treatment.;The efficacy of quantitative ultrasound (QUS) multi-parametric imaging in conjunction with unsupervised classification algorithms was investigated for the first time in characterizing intra-tumor regions to predict breast tumor response to chemotherapy before the start of treatment. QUS multi-parametric images of breast tumors were generated using the ultrasound radiofrequency data acquired from 181 patients diagnosed with locally advanced breast cancer and planned for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery. A hidden Markov random field (HMRF) expectation maximization (EM) algorithm was applied to identify distinct intra-tumor regions on QUS multi-parametric images. Several features were extracted from the segmented intra-tumor regions and tumor margin on different parametric images. A multi-step feature selection procedure was applied to construct a QUS biomarker consisting of four features for response prediction. Evaluation results on an independent test set indicated that the developed biomarker coupled with a decision tree model with adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) as the classifier could predict the treatment response of patient at pre-treatment with an accuracy of 85.4% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.89. In comparison, the biomarkers consisted of the features derived from the entire tumor core (without consideration of the intra-tumor regions), and the entire tumor core and the tumor margin could predict the treatment response of patients with an accuracy of 74.5% and 76.4%, and an AUC of 0.79 and 0.76, respectively. Standard clinical features could predict the therapy response with an accuracy of 69.1% and an AUC of 0.6. Long-term survival analyses indicated that the patients predicted by the developed model as responders had a significantly better survival compared to the non-responders. Similar findings were observed for the two response cohorts identified at post-treatment based on standard clinical and pathological criteria. The results obtained in this study demonstrated the potential of QUS multi-parametric imaging integrated with unsupervised learning methods in identifying distinct intra-tumor regions in breast cancer to characterize its responsiveness to chemotherapy prior to the start of treatment.;0
Clinical decision support system to optimise symptom management in palliative medicine: focus group study.;"OBJECTIVES: Suboptimal symptom control in patients with life-limiting illnesses is a major issue. A clinical decision support system (CDSS) that combines a patient-reported symptom assessment scale (SAS) and guideline-based individualised recommendations has the potential to improve symptom management. However, lacking end-user acceptance often prevents CDSS use in daily practice.We aimed to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a palliative care CDSS according to its targeted end-users. METHODS: Six focus groups with different groups of stakeholders were conducted: (1) patient representatives; (2) community nurses; (3) hospital nurses; (4) general practitioners; (5) hospital physicians and (6) palliative care specialists. Audiotapes were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Fifty-one stakeholders (6-12 per focus group) participated. Six themes were discussed: effect, validity, continuity, practical usability, implementation and additional features. All participants expected a CDSS to improve symptom management, for example, by reminding clinicians of blind spots and prompting patient participation. They feared interference with professional autonomy of physicians, doubted the validity of using a patient-reported SAS as CDSS input and thought lacking care continuity would complicate CDSS use. Clinicians needed clear criteria for when to use the CDSS (eg, life-limiting illness, timing in illness trajectory). Participants preferred a patient-coordinated system but were simultaneously concerned patients may be unwilling or unable to fill out an SAS. CONCLUSIONS: A palliative care CDSS was considered useful for improving symptom management. To develop a feasible system, barriers for successful implementation must be addressed including concerns about using a patient-reported SAS, lacking care continuity and unclear indications for use.";0
A transfer learning approach to facilitate ComBat-based harmonization of multicentre radiomic features in new datasets.;"PURPOSE: To facilitate the demonstration of the prognostic value of radiomics, multicenter radiomics studies are needed. Pooling radiomic features of such data in a statistical analysis is however challenging, as they are sensitive to the variability in scanner models, acquisition protocols and reconstruction settings, which is often unavoidable in a multicentre retrospective analysis. A statistical harmonization strategy called ComBat was utilized in radiomics studies to deal with the ""center-effect"". The goal of the present work was to integrate a transfer learning (TL) technique within ComBat-and recently developed alternate versions of ComBat with improved flexibility (M-ComBat) and robustness (B-ComBat)-to allow the use of a previously determined harmonization transform to the radiomic feature values of new patients from an already known center. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The proposed TL approach were incorporated in the four versions of ComBat (standard, B, M, and B-M ComBat). The proposed approach was evaluated using a dataset of 189 locally advanced cervical cancer patients from 3 centers, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images, with the clinical endpoint of predicting local failure. The impact performance of the TL approach was evaluated by comparing the harmonization achieved using only parts of the data to the reference (harmonization achieved using all the available data). It was performed through three different machine learning pipelines. RESULTS: The proposed TL technique was successful in harmonizing features of new patients from a known center in all versions of ComBat, leading to predictive models reaching similar performance as the ones developed using the features harmonized with all the data available. CONCLUSION: The proposed TL approach enables applying a previously determined ComBat transform to new, previously unseen data.";0
Camrelizumab versus placebo in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin as first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (CAPTAIN-1st): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial.;"BACKGROUND: The addition of camrelizumab to gemcitabine and cisplatin showed promising activity as first-line therapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma in a phase 1 trial. We therefore compared camrelizumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin with placebo plus gemcitabine and cisplatin in a randomised phase 3 trial. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial done at 28 hospitals in China, patients were eligible if they were aged 18-75 years, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, and had previously untreated recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1; using an interactive web-response system with a block size of four) to receive either camrelizumab (200 mg on day 1) or matching placebo intravenously, plus gemcitabine and cisplatin (gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8; cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) on day 1) intravenously every 3 weeks for four to six cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with camrelizumab or placebo, until radiographic progression, unacceptable toxicity, start of new anticancer treatment, investigator decision, or withdrawal of consent. Stratification factors used in randomisation were liver metastases, previous radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and ECOG performance status. The allocation sequence was generated by an independent randomisation group. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival per independent review committee. The significance threshold for independent review committee-assessed progression-free survival was p=0.0086 (one-sided) at the interim analysis. Efficacy and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03707509, and is closed for enrolment but is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Nov 13, 2018, and Nov 29, 2019, 343 patients were screened and 263 were eligible and were randomly assigned to the camrelizumab group (n=134) or placebo group (n=129). At the prespecified interim analysis (June 15, 2020), independent review committee-assessed progression-free survival was significantly longer in the camrelizumab group (median 9.7 months [95% CI 8.3-11.4]) than in the placebo group (median 6.9 months [5.9-7.3]; hazard ratio 0.54 [95% CI 0.39-0.76]; one-sided p=0.0002). As of Dec 31, 2020, the most common grade 3 or worse adverse events of any cause were decreased white blood cell count (89 [66%] of 134 patients in the camrelizumab group vs 90 [70%] of 129 patients in the placebo group), decreased neutrophil count (86 [64%] vs 85 [66%]), anaemia (53 [40%] vs 57 [44%]), and decreased platelet count (53 [40%] vs 52 [40%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 59 (44%) of 134 patients in the camrelizumab group and 48 (37%) of 129 patients in the placebo group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in five (4%) patients in the camrelizumab group (two unknown cause of death, one multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, one pharyngeal haemorrhage, and one arrhythmia) and one (<1%) patient in the placebo group (unknown cause of death). INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that camrelizumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin could be a new standard of care for patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the first-line setting. Longer follow-up is needed to confirm this conclusion. FUNDING: Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals (formerly Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine).

Transcranial photobiomodulation in the management of brain disorders.;"Transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) is the process of delivering light photons through the skull to benefit from its modifying effect. Brain disorders are important health problems. The aim of this review was to determine the existing evidence of effectiveness, useful parameters, and safety of tPBM in the management of traumatic brain injury, stroke, Parkinson, and Alzheimer's disease as the common brain disorders. Four online databases, including Cochrane, Pub Med, Embase, and Google scholar were searched according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. 4728 articles were obtained in the initial search. Only those articles that were published until September 2020 and designed as randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or animal-controlled studies were included. 6 RCTs, 2 related supplementary articles, and 38 controlled animal studies met the inclusion criteria of this study. No RCTs were performed in the fields of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The human RCTs and animal studies reported no adverse events resulted from the use of tPBM. Useful parameters of tPBM were identified according to the controlled animal studies. Since the investigated RCTs had no homogenous results, making an evidence-based decision for definite therapeutic application of tPBM is still unattainable. Altogether, these data support the need for large confirmatory well-designed RCTs for using tPBM as a novel, safe, and easy-to-administer treatment of brain disorders. EVIDENCE BEFORE THIS STUDY: High prevalence and complications of brain disorders and also side effects of neuropsychiatric medications have encouraged researchers to find alternative therapeutic techniques which tPBM can be one of them. In present review we tried to determine the existing evidence of effectiveness, useful parameters, and safety of tPBM in the management of traumatic brain injury, stroke, Alzheimer, and Parkinson's disease as common brain disorders. Four online databases, including ""Cochrane"", ""Pub Med"", ""Embase"", and ""Google scholar"" were searched. Only those articles that were published until September 2020 and designed as RCTs or animal-controlled studies were included. Search keywords were the followings: transcranial photobiomodulation"" OR ""transcranial low-level laser therapy"" AND ""stroke"" OR ""traumatic brain injury"" OR ""Alzheimer"" OR ""Parkinson"". Several studies have confirmed effectiveness of tPBM in treatment of different brain disorders but the level of evidence of its effectiveness remain to be determined. ADDED VALUE OF THIS STUDY: In this study we systematically reviewed human RCTs to determine the existing evidence of tPBM effectiveness in management of four mentioned brain disorders. Since the outcomes of the reviewed RCTs were not homogeneous, further well-designed RCTs are required to decide more definitively on the evidence of this noninvasive and probably safe therapeutic intervention. We hypothesized that non-homogeneous outcomes could be due to inefficiency of PBM parameters. Controlled animal studies have the advantage of using objective tests to evaluate the results and compare them with the control group. We determined useful tPBM parameters based on these studies. IMPLICATIONS OF ALL THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE: This research is part of our main project of tinnitus treatment using photobiomodulation (PBM). Evidence of central nervous system involvement in tinnitus led us to believe that treatment protocol of tinnitus should also include transcranial PBM. The determined useful parameters can be helpful in designing more efficient tPBM protocols in the management of brain disorders and tinnitus as a common debilitating symptom that can be associated with these disorders.";0
Low conflict and high satisfaction: Decisional outcomes after attending a combined clinic to choose between robotic prostatectomy and radiotherapy for prostate cancer.;"BACKGROUND: Decisional conflict and post-treatment decisional regret have been documented in men with localised prostate cancer (LPC). However, there is limited evidence regarding decisional outcomes associated with the choice between robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and radiotherapy, when both treatment options are available in the public health system. There is increasing support for multidisciplinary approaches to guide men with LPC in their decision-making process. This study assessed decisional outcomes in men deciding between RARP or radiotherapy treatment before and after attending a LPC combined clinic (CC). METHODS: Quantitative longitudinal data were collected from 52 men who attended a LPC CC, where they saw both a urologist and radiation oncologist. Patients completed questionnaires assessing involvement in decision-making, decisional conflict, satisfaction and regret before and after the CC, three months, six months and 12 months post-treatment. Urologists and radiation oncologists also reported their perceptions regarding patients' suitability for, openness to, perceived preferences and appropriateness for each treatment. Data was analysed using paired/independent samples t-tests and McNemar's tests. RESULTS: Most participants (n=37, 71%) opted for RARP over radiotherapy (n=14, 27%); one participant deferred treatment (2%). Urologists and radiation oncologists reported low agreement (kappa=0.26) regarding the most appropriate treatment for each patient. Participants reported a desire for high levels of control over their decision-making process (77.5% patient-led, 22.5% shared) and high levels of decisional satisfaction (M=4.4, SD=0.47) after the CC. Decisional conflict levels were significantly reduced (baseline: M=29.3, SD=16.9, post-CC: M=16.3, SD=11.5; t=5.37, P < 0.001) after the CC. Mean decisional regret scores were 'mild' at three-months (M=16.0, SD=17.5), six-months (M=18.8, SD=18.7) and 12-months (M=18.2, SD=15.1) post-treatment completion. CONCLUSION: This is the first Australian study to assess decisional outcomes when patients are offered the choice between RARP and radiotherapy in the public health system. A CC seems to support decision-making in men with LPC and positively impact some decisional outcomes. However, larger-scale controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.";0
Next-Generation Implementation of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy Using Digital Health.;"Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is a paradigm-shifting immunotherapy modality in oncology; however, unique toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome limit its ability to be implemented more widely in the outpatient setting or at smaller-volume centers. Three operational challenges with CAR-T therapy include the following: (1) the logistics of toxicity monitoring, ie, with frequent vital sign checks and neurologic assessments; (2) the specialized knowledge required for toxicity management, particularly with regard to CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome; and (3) the need for high-quality symptomatic and supportive care during this intensive period. In this review, we explore potential niches for digital innovations that can improve the implementation of CAR-T therapy in each of these domains. These tools include patient-facing technologies and provider-facing platforms: for example, wearable devices and mobile health apps to screen for fevers and encephalopathy, electronic patient-reported outcome assessments-based workflows to assist with symptom management, machine learning algorithms to predict emerging CRS in real time, clinical decision support systems to assist with toxicity management, and digital coaching to help maintain wellness. Televisits, which have grown in prominence since the novel coronavirus pandemic, will continue to play a key role in the monitoring and management of CAR-T-related toxicities as well. Limitations of these strategies include the need to ensure care equity and stakeholder buy-in, both operationally and financially. Nevertheless, once developed and validated, the next-generation implementation of CAR-T therapy using these digital tools may improve both its safety and accessibility.";0
Integrating Somatic and Germline Next-Generation Sequencing Into Routine Clinical Oncology Practice.;"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is rapidly expanding into routine oncology practice. Genetic variations in both the cancer and inherited genomes are informative for hereditary cancer risk, prognosis, and treatment strategies. Herein, we focus on the clinical perspective of integrating NGS results into patient care to assist with therapeutic decision making. Five key considerations are addressed for operationalization of NGS testing and application of results to patient care as follows: (1) NGS test ordering and workflow design; (2) result reporting, curation, and storage; (3) clinical consultation services that provide test interpretations and identify opportunities for molecularly guided therapy; (4) presentation of genetic information within the electronic health record; and (5) education of providers and patients. Several of these key considerations center on informatics tools that support NGS test ordering and referencing back to the results for therapeutic purposes. Clinical decision support tools embedded within the electronic health record can assist with NGS test utilization and identifying opportunities for targeted therapy including clinical trial eligibility. Challenges for project and change management in operationalizing NGS-supported, evidence-based patient care in the context of current information technology systems with appropriate clinical data standards are discussed, and solutions for overcoming barriers are provided.";0
Early health economic analysis of 1.5 T MRI-guided radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: Decision analytic modelling.;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging radiotherapy linear accelerator (MR-Linac) is gaining interest for treatment of localized prostate cancer. Clinical evidence is lacking and it therefore remains uncertain whether MR-Linac is cost-effective. An early health economic analysis was performed to calculate the necessary relative reduction in complications and the maximum price of MR-Linac (5 fractions) to be cost-effective compared to 5, 20 and 39 fractionation schedules of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A state transition model was developed for men with localized prostate cancer. Complication rates such as grade >/=2 urinary, grade >/=2 bowel and sexual complications, and utilities were based on systematic literature searches. Costs were estimated from a Dutch healthcare perspective. Threshold analyses were performed to identify the thresholds of complications and costs for MR-Linac to be cost-effective, while holding other outcomes such as biochemical progression and mortality constant. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to outline uncertainty outcomes. RESULTS: At euro6460 per patient, no reductions in complications were needed to consider MR-Linac cost-effective compared to EBRT 20 and 39 fractions. Compared to EBRT 5 fractions and LDR brachytherapy, MR-Linac was found to be cost-effective when complications are relatively reduced by 54% and 66% respectively. Results are highly sensitive to the utilities of urinary, bowel and sexual complications and the probability of biochemical progression. CONCLUSIONS: MR-Linac is found to be cost-effective compared to 20 and 39 fractions EBRT at baseline. For MR-Linac to become cost-effective over 5 fractions EBRT and LDR brachytherapy, it has to reduce complications substantially or be offered at lower costs.;0
Artificial Intelligence Applications to Improve the Treatment of Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers.;Locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients represent around one third of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients. There remains a large unmet need to find treatment strategies that can improve the survival of these patients while minimizing therapeutical side effects. Increasing the availability of patients' data (imaging, electronic health records, patients' reported outcomes, and genomics) will enable the application of AI algorithms to improve therapy selections. In this review, we discuss how artificial intelligence (AI) can be integral to improving clinical decision support systems. To realize this, a roadmap for AI must be defined. We define six milestones involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, from physicians to patients, that we feel are necessary for an optimal transition of AI into the clinic.;0
Tumor Treating Fields for Glioblastoma Therapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic.;BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed excessive strain on health care systems and is especially evident in treatment decision-making for cancer patients. Glioblastoma (GBM) patients are among the most vulnerable due to increased incidence in the elderly and the short survival time. A virtual meeting was convened on May 9, 2020 with a panel of neuro-oncology experts with experience using Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields). The objective was to assess the risk-to-benefit ratio and provide guidance for using TTFields in GBM during the COVID-19 pandemic. PANEL DISCUSSION: Topics discussed included support and delivery of TTFields during the COVID-19 pandemic, concomitant use of TTFields with chemotherapy, and any potential impact of TTFields on the immune system in an intrinsically immunosuppressed GBM population. Special consideration was given to TTFields' use in elderly patients and in combination with radiotherapy regimens. Finally, the panel discussed the need to better capture data on COVID-19positive brain tumor patients to analyze longitudinal outcomes and changes in treatment decision-making during the pandemic. EXPERT OPINION: TTFields is a portable home-use device which can be managed via telemedicine and safely used in GBM patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. TTFields has no known immunosuppressive effects which is important during a crisis where other treatment methods might be limited, especially for elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities. It is too early to estimate the full impact of COVID-19 on the global healthcare system and on patient outcomes and the panel strongly recommended collaboration with existing cancer COVID-19 registries to follow CNS tumor patients.;0
An interpretable machine learning prognostic system for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma based on tumor burden features.;OBJECTIVES: We aimed to build a survival system by combining a highly-accurate machine learning (ML) model with explainable artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to predict distant metastasis in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based tumor burden features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1643 patients from three hospitals were enrolled according to set criteria. We employed ML to develop a survival model based on tumor burden signatures and all clinical factors. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was utilized to explain prediction results and interpret the complex non-linear relationship among features and distant metastasis. We also constructed other models based on routinely used cancer stages, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA, or other clinical features for comparison. Concordance index (C-index), receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA) were executed to assess the effectiveness of the models. RESULTS: Our proposed system consistently demonstrated promising performance across independent cohorts. The concordance indexes were 0.773, 0.766 and 0.760 in the training, internal validation and external validation sets. SHAP provided personalized protective and risk factors for each NPC patient and uncovered some novel non-linear relationships between features and distant metastasis. Furthermore, high-risk patients who received induction chemotherapy (ICT) and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) had better 5-year distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) than those who only received CCRT, whereas ICT + CCRT and CCRT had similar DMFS in low-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: The interpretable machine learning system demonstrated superior performance in predicting metastasis in locoregionally advanced NPC. High-risk patients might benefit from ICT.;0
Exploring opportunities & pathways for advanced practice radiation therapy roles in the United States.;"The evolution of practice of Radiation Therapy in the United States (U.S.) is inevitable. The scope of a radiation therapists role has progressed with advancing technology, implementation of special procedures and patient care requirements. Internationally, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom have formalized this evolution through the Advanced Practice Radiation Therapist (APRT) role to provide new models of care, to meet growing demands in the practice of Radiation Oncology, to increase efficiency, decrease cost and retain skilled staff (Harnett et al., 2018; Society of Radiographers; Linden et al., 2019; Coleman et al., 2014) [1], [2], [3], [4]. Through evidence based practice, the APRT role has proven to provide benefits for multiple stakeholders including service-reconfiguration to reduce wait times, developing and retaining highly skilled radiation therapists, treatment review and most importantly improving patient care within much needed patient cohorts such as the palliative population (Duffton et al., 2019) [5]. The U.S. is no exception to requiring innovative care models and solutions to similar complex, care delivery challenges experienced internationally. The U.S. is experiencing an increase in demand for cancer services and a rapid rate of technological and treatment advancements. Under the current infrastructure, this has impacted the daily tasks of physicians; increasing workload, increasing the complexity of clinical decision making, increasing movement toward site specific subspecialty practice and pushing the scope of radiation therapists informally toward maximization, increased autonomy and a higher level of education and specialized skills (American Society of Clinical Oncology, 2016; ARRT, 2020; Vu et al., 2018) [6], [7], [8]. Objective The following reviews the current radiation therapy practice and professional landscape in the United States as it relates to advanced practice, exploring opportunities and challenges under the U.S. health care infrastructure. This broad analysis provides comparison to other countries and disciplines such as the Radiologist Assistant and Nurse Practitioner for potential pathways to establishing the role and describes current needs and value of the expanding scope of RT's practicing in the U.S.";0
Association of antidiabetic medication and statins with survival from ductal and lobular breast carcinoma in women with type 2 diabetes.;We investigated the survival of female patients with pre-existing type 2 diabetes (T2D) diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) of breast, in relation to the use of metformin, other antidiabetic medication (ADM) and statins. The study cohort consisted of 3,165 women (2,604 with IDC and 561 with ILC). The cumulative mortality from breast cancer (BC) and from other causes was calculated using the Aalen-Johansen estimator. The cause-specific mortality rates were analysed by Cox models, and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated for the use of different medications. No evidence of an association of metformin use with BC mortality was observed in either IDC (HR 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-1.31) or ILC (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.32-1.46) patients, when compared to other oral ADMs. The mortality from other causes was found to be lower amongst the IDC patients using metformin (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.89), but amongst ILC patients the evidence was inconclusive (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.64-2.32). Statin use was consistently associated with reduced mortality from BC in IDC patients (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.96) and ILC patients (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.37-0.96), and also mortality from other causes in IDC patients (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.96) and in ILC patients (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.43-1.01). We found no sufficient evidence for the possible effects of metformin and statins on the prognosis of BC being different in the two histological subtypes.;0
Integrative evaluation of primary and metastatic lesion spectrum to guide anti-PD-L1 therapy of non-small cell lung cancer: results from two randomized studies.;Objectives: Clinical benefits of immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) versus standard chemotherapy have been established in unselected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the response to ICB therapy among patients is heterogeneous in clinical practice. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively assessed the predicitive effect of the primary and metastatic lesion spectrum (baseline sum of the longest diameters [SLD], number of metastatic sites and specific organ metastases) on the efficacy of atezolizumab over docetaxel in OAK and POPLAR trial cohorts. A decision model, termed DSO (Diameter-Site-Organ), based on the spectrum was developed and validated for guiding ICB. Results: Higher SLD (>38 mm) and more metastatic sites (>/=2) were characterized with pronounced overall survival (OS) benefits from atezolizumab versus docetaxel. Specifically, adrenal gland and brain metastases were identified as favorable predictors of atezolizumab treatment. The DSO model was developed in the discovery cohort to integrate the directive effect of the primary and metastatic lesion spectrum. Remarkably, a general pattern of enhanced efficacy of atezolizumab versus docetaxel was observed along with the increase of the DSO score. For patients with DSO score > 0, atezolizumab yielded a significantly prolonged OS than docetaxel, whereas OS was generally similar between two treatments in patients with DSO score </= 0. Equivalent findings were also seen in the internal and external validation cohorts. Conclusions: The response to anti-PD-L1 therapy among patients varied with the primary and metastatic lesion spectrum. The DSO-based system might provide promising medication guidance for ICB treatment in NSCLC patients.;0
Computed Tomography-Based Delta-Radiomics Analysis for Discriminating Radiation Pneumonitis in Patients With Esophageal Cancer After Radiation Therapy.;PURPOSE: Our purpose was to construct a computed tomography (CT)-based delta-radiomics nomogram and corresponding risk classification system for individualized and accurate estimation of severe acute radiation pneumonitis (SARP) in patients with esophageal cancer (EC) after radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four hundred patients with EC were enrolled from 2 independent institutions and were divided into the training (n = 200) and validation (n = 200) cohorts. Eight hundred fifty radiomics features of lung were extracted from treatment planning images, including the positioning CT before radiation therapy (CT(1)) and the resetting CT after receiving 40 to 45 Gy (CT(2)). The longitudinal net changes in radiomics features from CT(1) to CT(2) were calculated and defined as delta-radiomics features. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm was performed to features selection and delta-radiomics signature building. Integrating the signature with multidimensional clinicopathologic, dosimetric, and hematological predictors of SARP, a novel CT-based delta-radiomics nomogram was established according to multivariate analysis. The clinical application values of nomogram were both evaluated in the training and validation cohorts by concordance index, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. Recursive partitioning analysis was used to generate a risk classification system. RESULTS: The delta-radiomics signature consisting of 24 features was significantly associated with SARP status (P < .001). Incorporating it with other high-risk factors, Subjective Global Assessment score, pulmonary fibrosis score, mean lung dose, and systemic immune inflammation index, the developed delta-radiomics nomogram showed increased improvement in SARP discrimination accuracy with concordance index of 0.975 and 0.921 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Calibration curves and decision curve analysis confirmed the satisfactory clinical feasibility and utility of nomogram. The risk classification system displayed excellent performance on identifying SARP occurrence (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The delta-radiomics nomogram and risk classification system as low-cost and noninvasive means exhibited superior predictive accuracy and provided individualized probability of SARP stratification for patients with EC.;0
A nomogram prediction of overall survival based on lymph node ratio, AJCC 8th staging system, and other factors for primary pancreatic cancer.;BACKGROUND: As a malignant tumor with poor prognosis, accurate and effective prediction of the prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC) is crucial. METHODS: A total of 12,909 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program between 2004 and 2016. The sex, age, ethnicity, marital status, metastasis status, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, tumor size, regional nodes examined, regional nodes positive of each patient were recorded. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify prognostic factors with a threshold of P<0.05, and a nomogram was constructed. Harrell's concordance indexes and calibration plots were used to verify the predictive power of the model. The risk groups were also stratified by quartile of the total score. Survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Age, year of diagnosis, sex, grade, histologic, marital, TNM stage, surgery of the primary site, tumor size, regional nodes positive and regional nodes examined ratio (LNR), lymph node dissection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were identified as prognostic factors for the construction of the nomogram. The nomogram exhibited a clinical predictive ability of 0.675(95% CI, 0.669~0.681) in the internal verification. The predicted calibration curve was similar to the standard curve. Decision curve analysis showed that the nomogram had value in terms of clinical application. Besides, the nomogram was able to divide the patients into different groups according to total points. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, our nomogram was highly effective in predicting overall survival in patients with PC, which may provide a reference tool for clinicians to guide individualized treatment and follow-ups for patients with PC, accurately determine the 1-,3- and 5-year overall survival of patients.;0
Short Communication: Interim toxicity analysis for patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer (LSCLC) treated on CALGB 30610 (Alliance) / RTOG 0538.;INTRODUCTION: The CALGB 30610/RTOG 0538 randomized trial was designed to test whether high-dose thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) would improve survival compared with 45 Gy twice-daily (BID) TRT in limited stage small cell lung cancer (LSCLC). Two piloted experimental TRT regimens were of interest to study, 70 Gy daily (QD) and 61.2 Gy concomitant boost (CB). Driven by concerns about adequate patient accrual, a study design was employed that eliminated one experimental TRT arm based on early interim toxicity and tolerability, with the study then continuing as a traditional 2-arm phase III study. METHODS: Patients with LSCLC were assigned to receive four cycles of cisplatin and etoposide chemotherapy with one of 3 TRT regimens starting with either the first or second cycle of chemotherapy. The interim endpoint was the cumulative highest toxicity calculated from a scoring system based on treatment-related grade 3 and higher toxicity and the ability to complete therapy in the experimental arms. RESULTS: The final interim analysis was performed after 70 patients accrued to each experimental cohort, and a difference in treatment related toxicity scoring was not found (p = 0.739). Severe esophageal toxicity was comparable in both cohorts. Pulmonary toxicity was low overall, though 4 patients (5.7 %) on the 61.2 Gy arm developed grade 4 dyspnea, which was not observed in the 70 Gy arm. A protocol mandated decision was made to discontinue the 61.2 Gy arm following review of toxicity with the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. CONCLUSION: A randomized trial design using a planned early interim toxicity analysis to discriminate between experimental treatment arms is feasible in a phase III setting. Refinement of the design could increase the likelihood of detecting clinically meaningful differences in toxicity in future studies.;0
Effects of 3D image-guided brachytherapy compared to 2D conventional brachytherapy on clinical outcomes in patients with cervical cancer: A systematic review and meta-analyses.;PURPOSE: To assess the effects of three-dimensional image-guided brachytherapy (3D BT) compared to bi-dimensional BT (2D BT) on clinical outcomes in patients with cervical cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and LILACS for studies assessing the effects of 3D BT versus 2D BT on clinical outcomes. Two reviewers independently screened retrieved citations, extracted data and assessed risk of bias from eligible studies. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated from Kaplan-Meier curves considering the number of events, their timing and the followup of censored patients. We conducted meta-analyses of HR using the inverse-variance random-effects method. Risk Difference (RD) for toxicities were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects method. We used the GRADE system to rate the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Twenty observational studies involving 4287 patients were included. The meta-analyses assessing the effect of 3D BT versus 2D BT on overall survival resulted in a HR of 0.78 (95%CI 0.62-0.98), HR of 0.75 (95%CI 0.62-0.90) for pelvic disease-free survival, HR of 0.93 (95%CI 0.81-1.06) for metastatic disease-free survival, and HR of 0.77 (95%CI 0.59-0.99) for local control. Grade 3-4 global and gastrointestinal toxicities were, respectively, 9% lower (95%CI 6% to 11%) and 5% lower (95%CI 2% to 8%) in patients receiving 3D BT versus 2D BT. Certainty of evidence was very low for all assessed outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study may suggest a benefit of 3D BT over conventional 2D BT on important clinical outcomes.;0
Treatment planning facilitates clinical decision making for hyperthermia treatments.;Background: Treatment quality is important in clinical hyperthermia. Guideline-based treatment protocols are used to determine system settings and treatment strategies to ensure effective tumor heating and prevent unwanted treatment-limiting normal tissue hot spots. Realizing both these goals can prove challenging using generic guideline-based and operator-dependent treatment strategies. Hyperthermia treatment planning (HTP) can be very useful to support treatment strategies. Although HTP is increasingly integrated into the standard clinical workflow, active clinical application is still limited to a small number of hyperthermia centers and should be further stimulated.Purpose: This paper aims to serve as a practical guide, demonstrating how HTP can be applied in clinical decision making for both superficial and locoregional hyperthermia treatments.HTP in clinical decision making: Seven problems that occur in daily clinical practice are described and we show how HTP can enhance insight to formulate an adequate treatment strategy. Examples use representative commercially available hyperthermia devices and cover all stages during the clinical workflow. Problems include selecting adequate phase settings, heating ability analysis, hot spot suppression, applicator selection, evaluation of target coverage and heating depth, and predicting possible thermal toxicity in case of an implant. Since we aim to promote a general use of HTP in daily practice, basic simulation strategies are used in these problems, avoiding a need for the application of dedicated advanced optimization routines that are not generally available.Conclusion: Even fairly basic HTP can facilitate clinical decision making, providing a meaningful and clinically relevant contribution to maintaining and improving treatment quality.;0
Immunotherapy use outside clinical trial populations: never say never?;BACKGROUND: Based on favourable outcomes in clinical trials, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), most notably programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, are now widely used across multiple cancer types. However, due to their strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical studies often do not address challenges presented by non-trial populations. DESIGN: This review summarises available data on the efficacy and safety of ICIs in trial-ineligible patients, including those with autoimmune disease, chronic viral infections, organ transplants, organ dysfunction, poor performance status, and brain metastases, as well as the elderly, children, and those who are pregnant. In addition, we review data concerning other real-world challenges with ICIs, including timing of therapy switch, relationships to radiotherapy or surgery, re-treatment after an immune-related toxicity, vaccinations in patients on ICIs, and current experience around ICI and coronavirus disease-19. Where possible, we provide recommendations to aid the often-difficult decision-making process in those settings. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that ICIs are often active and have an acceptable safety profile in the populations described above, with the exception of PD-1 inhibitors in solid organ transplant recipients. Decisions about whether to treat with ICIs should be personalised and require multidisciplinary input and careful counselling of patients with respect to potential risks and benefits. Clinical judgements need to be carefully weighed, considering factors such as underlying cancer type, feasibility of alternative treatment options, or activity in trial-eligible patients.;0
Conversion of a colorectal cancer guideline into clinical decision trees with assessment of validity.;OBJECTIVE: The interpretation and clinical application of guidelines can be challenging and time-consuming, which may result in noncompliance to guidelines. The aim of this study was to convert the Dutch guideline for colorectal cancer (CRC) into decision trees and subsequently implement decision trees in an online decision support environment to facilitate guideline application. METHODS: The recommendations of the Dutch CRC guidelines (published in 2014) were translated into decision trees consisting of decision nodes, branches and leaves that represent data items, data item values and recommendations, respectively. Decision trees were discussed with experts in the field and published as interactive open access decision support software (available at www.oncoguide.nl). Decision tree validation and a concordance analysis were performed using consecutive reports (January 2016-January 2017) from CRC multidisciplinary tumour boards (MTBs) at Amsterdam University Medical Centers, location AMC. RESULTS: In total, we developed 34 decision trees driven by 101 decision nodes based on the guideline recommendations. Decision trees represented recommendations for diagnostics (n = 1), staging (n = 10), primary treatment (colon: n = 1, rectum: n = 5, colorectal: n = 9), pathology (n = 4) and follow-up (n = 3) and included one overview decision tree for optimal navigation. We identified several guideline information gaps and areas of inconclusive evidence. A total of 158 patients' MTB reports were eligible for decision tree validation and resulted in treatment recommendations in 80% of cases. The concordance rate between decision tree treatment recommendations and MTB advices was 81%. Decision trees reported in 22 out of 24 non-concordant cases (92%) that no guideline recommendation was available. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully converted the Dutch CRC guideline into decision trees and identified several information gaps and areas of inconclusive evidence, the latter being the main cause of the observed disagreement between decision tree recommendations and MTB advices. Decision trees may contribute to future strategies to optimize quality of care for CRC patients.;0
Survival and Prognostic Factors of Adult Intracranial Ependymoma: A Single-institutional Analysis of 236 Patients.;Adult intracranial ependymomas (EPNs) are extremely rare brain tumors. Currently, clinical and molecular factors that could inform individualized treatment strategies are still lacking for EPNs in this age group. The aim of this study was to investigate potential prognostic indicators and rational therapeutic management in a large cohort of adult intracranial EPNs. Adult patients who underwent resection of World Health Organization (WHO) grade II or III intracranial EPNs were included. The demographic features, clinicopathologic manifestations, molecular subgroups, and outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. Overall survival and progression-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Potential prognostic indicators were identified using multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. This cohort included 236 adult patients with a mean age of 36.2 years (range: 18 to 72 y) at diagnosis. The tumor location was supratentorial (ST) in 102 (43.2%) and infratentorial in 134 (56.8%). Pathologic analysis revealed 43.1% of ST-EPNs with RELA fusion and 88.1% of posterior fossa ependymomas (PF-EPNs) with positive H3K27me3 staining. Gross total removal was achieved in 169 cases (71.6%). During follow-up, 97 (41.1%) patients had disease progression and 39 (16.5%) died. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with H3K27me3-positive PF-EPN had excellent survival, whereas patients with RELA fusion-positive ST-EPN or H3K27me3-negative PF-EPN had poor prognosis (progression-free survival: P=1.3E-16, overall survival: P=2.5E-12). Multivariate analysis showed that molecular subgroup, extent of resection, and Ki-67 index were strong independent prognostic indicators. In conclusion, our study provides essential information on the prognostic prediction of adult intracranial EPNs that will assist in establishing appropriate risk stratification and individualized treatment strategies in future clinical trials.;0
A composite single-nucleotide polymorphism prediction signature for extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.;"Current prognostic scoring systems based on clinicopathologic variables are inadequate in predicting the survival and treatment response of extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) patients undergoing nonanthracyline-based treatment. We aimed to construct a classifier based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for improving predictive accuracy and guiding clinical decision making. Data from 722 patients with ENKTL from international centers were analyzed. A 7-SNP-based classifier was constructed using LASSO Cox regression in the training cohort (n = 336) and further validated in the internal testing cohort (n = 144) and in 2 external validation cohorts (n = 142 and n = 100). The 7-SNP-based classifier showed good prognostic predictive efficacy in the training cohort and the 3 validation cohorts. Patients with high- and low-risk scores calculated by the classifier exhibited significantly different progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (all P < .001). The 7-SNP-based classifier was further proved to be an independent prognostic factor by multivariate analysis, and its predictive accuracy was significantly better than clinicopathological risk variables. Application of the 7-SNP-based classifier was not affected by sample types. Notably, chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy significantly improved PFS and OS vs radiotherapy alone in high-risk Ann Arbor stage I patients, whereas there was no statistical difference between the 2 therapeutic modalities among low-risk patients. A nomogram was constructed comprising the classifier and clinicopathological variables; it showed remarkably better predictive accuracy than either variable alone. The 7-SNP-based classifier is a complement to existing risk-stratification systems in ENKTL, which could have significant implications for clinical decision making for patients with ENKTL.";0
Cumulative effective dose from recurrent CT examinations in Europe: proposal for clinical guidance based on an ESR EuroSafe Imaging survey.;In recent years, the issue of cumulative effective dose received from recurrent computed tomography examinations has become a subject of increasing concern internationally. Evidence, predominantly from the USA, has shown that a significant number of patients receive a cumulative effective dose of 100 mSv or greater. To obtain a European perspective, EuroSafe Imaging carried out a survey to collect European data on cumulative radiation exposure of patients from recurrent computed tomography examinations. The survey found that a relatively low percentage of patients (0.5%) received a cumulative effective dose equal to or higher than 100 mSv from computed tomography, most of them having an oncological disease. However, there is considerable variation between institutions as these values ranged from 0 to 2.72%, highlighting that local practice or, depending on the institution and its medical focus, local patient conditions are likely to be a significant factor in the levels of cumulative effective dose received, rather than this simply being a global phenomenon. This paper also provides some practical actions to support the management of cumulative effective dose and to refine or improve practice where recurrent examinations are required. These actions are focused around increasing awareness of referring physicians through encouraging local dialogue, actions focused on optimisation where a team approach is critical, better use of modern equipment and the use of Dose Management and Clinical Decision Support Systems together with focused clinical audits. The proper use of cumulative effective dose should be part of training programmes for referrers and practitioners, including what information to give to patients. Radiation is used to the benefit of patients in diagnostic procedures such as CT examinations, and in therapeutic procedures like the external radiation treatment for cancer. However, radiation is also known to increase the risk of cancer. To oversee this risk, the cumulative effective dose (CED) received by a patient from imaging procedures over his or her life is important. In this paper, the authors, on behalf of EuroSafe Imaging, report on a survey carried out in Europe that aims to estimate the proportion of patients that undergo CT examinations and are exposed to a CED of more than 100 mSv. At the same time, the survey enquires about and underlines radiologists' measures and radiology departments' strategies to limit such exposure. Over the period of 2015-2018, respondents reported that 0.5% (0-2.72%) of patients were exposed to a CED of >/= 100 mSv from imaging procedures. The background radiation dose in Europe depends on the location, but it is around 2.5 mSv per year. It is obvious that patients with cancer, chronic diseases and trauma run the highest risk of having a high CED. However, even if the number of patients exposed to >/= 100 mSv is relatively low, it is important to lower this number even further. Measures could consist in using procedures that do not necessitate radiation, using very low dose procedures, being very critical in requiring imaging procedures and increasing awareness about the issue. KEY POINTS: * A relatively low percentage of patients (0.5%) received a cumulative effective dose from CT computed tomography equal to or greater than 100 mSv, in Europe, most of them having an oncological disease. * There is a wide range in the number of patients who receive cumulative effective dose equal to or greater than 100 mSv (0-2.72%) and optimisation should be improved. * Increasing the awareness of referring physicians through encouraging local dialogue, concrete actions focused on optimisation and development of dose management systems is suggested.;0
Medical imaging and nuclear medicine: a Lancet Oncology Commission.;The diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancer requires access to imaging to ensure accurate management decisions and optimal outcomes. Our global assessment of imaging and nuclear medicine resources identified substantial shortages in equipment and workforce, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). A microsimulation model of 11 cancers showed that the scale-up of imaging would avert 3.2% (2.46 million) of all 76.0 million deaths caused by the modelled cancers worldwide between 2020 and 2030, saving 54.92 million life-years. A comprehensive scale-up of imaging, treatment, and care quality would avert 9.55 million (12.5%) of all cancer deaths caused by the modelled cancers worldwide, saving 232.30 million life-years. Scale-up of imaging would cost US$6.84 billion in 2020-30 but yield lifetime productivity gains of $1.23 trillion worldwide, a net return of $179.19 per $1 invested. Combining the scale-up of imaging, treatment, and quality of care would provide a net benefit of $2.66 trillion and a net return of $12.43 per $1 invested. With the use of a conservative approach regarding human capital, the scale-up of imaging alone would provide a net benefit of $209.46 billion and net return of $31.61 per $1 invested. With comprehensive scale-up, the worldwide net benefit using the human capital approach is $340.42 billion and the return per dollar invested is $2.46. These improved health and economic outcomes hold true across all geographical regions. We propose actions and investments that would enhance access to imaging equipment, workforce capacity, digital technology, radiopharmaceuticals, and research and training programmes in LMICs, to produce massive health and economic benefits and reduce the burden of cancer globally.;0
Model based patient pre-selection for intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) using automated treatment planning and machine learning.;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patient selection for intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT), using comparative photon therapy planning, is workload-intensive and time-consuming. Pre-selection aims at avoidance of manual IMPT planning for patients that are in the end ineligible. We investigated the use of machine learning together with automated IMPT treatment planning for pre-selection of head and neck cancer patients, and validated the methodology for the Dutch model based selection (MBS) approach. MATERIALS & METHODS: For forty-five head and neck patients with a previous MBS, an IMPT plan was generated with non-clinical, fully-automated planning. Dosimetric differences of these plans with the corresponding previously generated photon plans, and the outcomes of the former MBS, were used to train a Gaussian naive Bayes classifier for MBS outcome prediction. During training, strong emphasis was placed on avoiding misclassification of IMPT eligible patients (i.e. false negatives). RESULTS: Pre-selection with the classifier resulted in 0 false negatives, 12 (27%) true negatives, 27 (60%) true positives, and only 6 (13%) false positive predictions. Using this pre-selection, the number of formal selection procedures with involved manual IMPT planning that resulted in a negative outcome could be reduced by 67%. CONCLUSION: With pre-selection, using machine learning and automated treatment planning, the percentage of patients with unnecessary manual IMPT planning for MBS could be drastically reduced, thereby saving costs, labor and time. With the developed approach, larger patient populations can be screened, and likely bias in pre-selection of patients can be mitigated by assisting the physician during patient pre-selection.;0
Artificial Intelligence in Decision-Making for Colorectal Cancer Treatment Strategy: An Observational Study of Implementing Watson for Oncology in a 250-Case Cohort.;"BACKGROUND: Personalized and novel evidence-based clinical treatment strategy consulting for colorectal cancer has been available through various artificial intelligence (AI) supporting systems such as Watson for Oncology (WFO) from IBM. However, the potential effects of this supporting tool in cancer care have not been thoroughly explored in real-world studies. This research aims to investigate the concordance between treatment recommendations for colorectal cancer patients made by WFO and a multidisciplinary team (MDT) at a major comprehensive gastrointestinal cancer center. METHODS: In this prospective study, both WFO and the blinded MDT's treatment recommendations were provided concurrently for enrolled colorectal cancers of stages II to IV between March 2017 and January 2018 at Shanghai Minimally Invasive Surgery Center. Concordance was achieved if the cancer team's decisions were listed in the ""recommended"" or ""for consideration"" classification in WFO. A review was carried out after 100 cases for all non-concordant patients to explain the inconsistency, and corresponding feedback was given to WFO's database. The concordance of the subsequent cases was analyzed to evaluate both the performance and learning ability of WFO. RESULTS: Overall, 250 patients met the inclusion criteria and were recruited in the study. Eighty-one were diagnosed with colon cancer and 189 with rectal cancer. The concordances for colon cancer, rectal cancer, or overall were all 91%. The overall rates were 83, 94, and 88% in subgroups of stages II, III, and IV. When categorized by treatment strategy, concordances were 97, 93, 89, 87, and 100% for neoadjuvant, surgery, adjuvant, first line, and second line treatment groups, respectively. After analyzing the main factors causing discordance, relative updates were made in the database accordingly, which led to the concordance curve rising in most groups compared with the initial rates. CONCLUSION: Clinical recommendations made by WFO and the cancer team were highly matched for colorectal cancer. Patient age, cancer stage, and the consideration of previous therapy details had a significant influence on concordance. Addressing these perspectives will facilitate the use of the cancer decision-support systems to help oncologists achieve the promise of precision medicine.";0
Salvage Radiotherapy Management Decisions in Postprostatectomy Patients with Recurrent Prostate Cancer Based on (18)F-Fluciclovine PET/CT Guidance.;"Imaging with novel PET radiotracers has significantly influenced radiotherapy decision making and radiation planning in patients with recurrent prostate cancer (PCa). The purpose of this analysis was to report the final results for management decision changes based on (18)F-fluciclovine PET/CT findings and determine whether the decision change trend remained after completion of accrual. Methods: Patients with detectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after prostatectomy were randomized to undergo either conventional imaging (CI) only (arm A) or CI plus (18)F-fluciclovine PET/CT (arm B) before radiotherapy. In arm B, positivity rates on CI and (18)F-fluciclovine PET/CT for detection of recurrent PCa were determined. Final decisions on whether to offer radiotherapy and whether to include only the prostate bed or also the pelvis in the radiotherapy field were based on (18)F-fluciclovine PET/CT findings. Radiotherapy decisions before and after (18)F-fluciclovine PET/CT were compared. The statistical significance of decision changes was determined using the Clopper-Pearson (exact) binomial method. Prognostic factors were compared between patients with and without decision changes. Results: All 165 patients enrolled in the study had standard-of-care CI and were initially planned to receive radiotherapy. Sixty-three of 79 (79.7%) patients (median PSA, 0.33 ng/mL) who underwent (18)F-fluciclovine PET/CT (arm B) had positive findings. (18)F-Fluciclovine PET/CT had a significantly higher positivity rate than CI did for the whole body (79.7% vs. 13.9%; P < 0.001), prostate bed (69.6% vs. 5.1%; P < 0.001), and pelvic lymph nodes (38.0% vs. 10.1%; P < 0.001). Twenty-eight of 79 (35.4%) patients had the overall radiotherapy decision changed after (18)F-fluciclovine PET/CT; in 4 of 79 (5.1%), the decision to use radiotherapy was withdrawn because of extrapelvic disease detected on (18)F-fluciclovine PET/CT. In 24 of 75 (32.0%) patients with a final decision to undergo radiotherapy, the radiotherapy field was changed. Changes in overall radiotherapy decisions and radiotherapy fields were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Overall, the mean PSA at PET was significantly different between patients with and without radiotherapy decision changes (P = 0.033). Conclusion:(18)F-Fluciclovine PET/CT significantly altered salvage radiotherapy decisions in patients with recurrent PCa after prostatectomy. Further analysis to determine the impact of (18)F-fluciclovine PET/CT guidance on clinical outcomes after radiotherapy is in progress.";0
Radiomics-Based Prediction of Long-Term Treatment Response of Vestibular Schwannomas Following Stereotactic Radiosurgery.;OBJECTIVE: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is one of the treatment modalities for vestibular schwannomas (VSs). However, tumor progression can still occur after treatment. Currently, it remains unknown how to predict long-term SRS treatment outcome. This study investigates possible magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based predictors of long-term tumor control following SRS. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Analysis was performed on a database containing 735 patients with unilateral VS, treated with SRS between June 2002 and December 2014. Using strict volumetric criteria for long-term tumor control and tumor progression, a total of 85 patients were included for tumor texture analysis. INTERVENTION(S): All patients underwent SRS and had at least 2 years of follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Quantitative tumor texture features were extracted from conventional MRI scans. These features were supplied to a machine learning stage to train prediction models. Prediction accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) are evaluated. RESULTS: Gray-level co-occurrence matrices, which capture statistics from specific MRI tumor texture features, obtained the best prediction scores: 0.77 accuracy, 0.71 sensitivity, 0.83 specificity, and 0.93 AUC. These prediction scores further improved to 0.83, 0.83, 0.82, and 0.99, respectively, for tumors larger than 5 cm. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study show the feasibility of predicting the long-term SRS treatment response of VS tumors on an individual basis, using MRI-based tumor texture features. These results can be exploited for further research into creating a clinical decision support system, facilitating physicians, and patients to select a personalized optimal treatment strategy.;0
Patient-derived organoid (PDO) platforms to facilitate clinical decision making.;Based on recent advances in organoid research as well as the need to find more accurate models for drug screening in cancer research, patient-derived organoids have emerged as an effective in vitro model system to study cancer. Showing numerous advantages over 2D cell lines, 3D cell lines, and primary cell culture, organoids have been applied in drug screening to demonstrate the correlation between genetic mutations and sensitivity to targeted therapy. Organoids have also been used in co-clinical trials to compare drug responses in organoids to clinical responses in the corresponding patients. Numerous studies have reported the successful use of organoids to predict therapy response in cancer patients. Recently, organoids have been adopted to predict treatment response to radiotherapy and immunotherapy. The development of high throughput drug screening and organoids-on-a-chip technology can advance the use of patient-derived organoids in clinical practice and facilitate therapeutic decision-making.;0
Nomogram Predicting the Risk of Locoregional Recurrence After Mastectomy for Invasive Micropapillary Carcinoma of the Breast.;"BACKGROUND: The risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR) after mastectomy for breast invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) remains poorly defined. We aimed to construct an effective prognostic nomogram to estimate the individualized risk of LRR for providing accurate information for long-term follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 388 patients with breast IMPC were included in the current study. Based on the Cox regression and clinical significance, a nomogram with an online prediction version was created. This model was evaluated and internally validated by concordance index and calibration plot. Receiver operating characteristic curve and decision curve analysis were used to assess the discrimination and clinical utility, and Kaplan-Meier curves estimated the probability of LRR. RESULTS: The variables (age, lymph node metastasis, hormone receptor status, lymphovascular invasion, histologic grade, and adjuvant radiotherapy) were included in the nomogram. This model was well-calibrated to predict the possibility of LRR and displayed favorable clinical utility; the concordance index was 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.91), which was higher than any single predictor. The area under the curve of the nomogram was 0.89, whereas that of the conventional staging system was 0.72. An online prognostic nomogram was built for convenient use. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the nomogram had a better risk stratification than the conventional staging system. CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram could accurately predict the individualized risk of LRR after mastectomy for breast IMPC. By identifying the risk stratification, this model is expected to assist clinicians and patients in improving long-term follow-up strategies.";0
Development of a Nomogram Model for Treatment of Nonmetastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.;"IMPORTANCE: Because of tumor heterogeneity, overall survival (OS) differs significantly among individuals with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), even among those with the same clinical stage. Relying solely on TNM staging to guide treatment remains imperfect. OBJECTIVES: To establish a comprehensive nomogram to estimate individualized OS and to explore stratified treatment regimens for risk subgroups in nonmetastatic NPC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included 8093 patients diagnosed with NPC at a single center in China from April 2009 to December 2015. The sample was split into a training cohort (5398 participants [66.7%]) and validation cohort (2695 [33.3%]). Data were analyzed in May 2020. EXPOSURES: Age, T stage, N stage, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA level, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and albumin (ALB) levels. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was OS. The nomogram for estimating OS was generated based on multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. The performance of the nomogram was quantified using Harrell concordance index (C index), the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve, and a calibration curve. OS rates were established using the Kaplan-Meier method, and intersubgroup differences were examined by the log-rank test. RESULTS: Among the 8093 participants, 5688 (70.3%) were men, and the median age at diagnosis was 45 years (range, 7-85 years). Six variables (age, T stage, N stage, EBV DNA levels, LDH levels, and ALB levels) were identified through multivariate Cox regression and incorporated into a nomogram to estimate OS. The resulting nomogram showed excellent discriminative ability and significantly outperformed the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control TNM staging system for estimating OS (C index, 0.716 [95% CI, 0.698-0.734] vs 0.643 [95% CI, 0.624-0.661]; P < .001; AUC, 0.717 [95% CI, 0.698-0.737] vs 0.643 [95% CI, 0.623-0.662]; P < .001), and the calibration curves showed satisfactory agreement between the actual and nomogram-estimated OS rates. The validation cohort confirmed the results. Patients were stratified into 4 risk groups based on the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile score values estimated from the nomogram. The 4 nomogram-defined risk groups demonstrated significantly different intergroup OS (3-year OS rates: risk group 1, 1328 of 1345 [98.7%]; risk group 2, 1289 of 1341 [96.1%]; risk group 3, 1222 of 1321 [92.5%]; risk group 4, 1173 of 1391 [84.3%]; P < .001). These risk groups were associated with the efficacy of different treatment regimens. For example, for risk group 4, induction chemotherapy with concurrent chemoradiotherapy was associated with a significantly better OS than concurrent chemoradiotherapy (log-rank P = .008) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy alone (log-rank P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the proposed nomogram model enabled individualized prognostication of OS and could help to guide risk-adapted treatment for patients with nonmetastatic NPC.";0
Management of immune checkpoint therapy for patients with cancer in the face of COVID-19.;The COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 challenges the medical system by interfering with routine therapies for many patients with chronic diseases. In patients with cancer receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), difficulties also arise from the incomplete understanding of the intricate interplay between their routine treatment and pathogenesis of the novel virus. By referring to previous ICI-based investigations, we speculate that ICIs themselves are not linked to high-infection risks of respiratory diseases or inflammation-related adverse effects in patients with cancer. Moreover, ICI treatment may even enhance coronavirus clearance in some patients with malignant tumor by boosting antiviral T-cell responsiveness. However, the 'explosive' inflammation during COVID-19 in some ICI-treated patients with cancer was illustrated as exuberant immunopathological damage or even death. In case of the COVID-19 immunopathogenesis fueled by ICIs, we propose a regular monitor of pathogenic T-cell subsets and their exhaustion marker expression (eg, Th17 and interleukin (IL)-6-producing Th1 subsets with surface programmed death 1 expression) to guide the usage of ICI. Here we aimed to address these considerations, based on available literature and experience from our practice, that may assist with the decision-making of ICI administration during the pandemic.;0
Artificial intelligence (AI) and interventional radiotherapy (brachytherapy): state of art and future perspectives.;PURPOSE: Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a central role in building decision supporting systems (DSS), and its application in healthcare is rapidly increasing. The aim of this study was to define the role of AI in healthcare, with main focus on radiation oncology (RO) and interventional radiotherapy (IRT, brachytherapy). ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN INTERVENTIONAL RADIATION THERAPY: AI in RO has a large impact in providing clinical decision support, data mining and advanced imaging analysis, automating repetitive tasks, optimizing time, and modelling patients and physicians' behaviors in heterogeneous contexts. Implementing AI and automation in RO and IRT can successfully facilitate all the steps of treatment workflow, such as patient consultation, target volume delineation, treatment planning, and treatment delivery. CONCLUSIONS: AI may contribute to improve clinical outcomes through the application of predictive models and DSS optimization. This approach could lead to reducing time-consuming repetitive tasks, healthcare costs, and improving treatment quality assurance and patient's assistance in IRT.;0
Evaluation of Definitive Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy and Outcomes in Adults With Extracranial Oligometastasis.;"IMPORTANCE: The outcomes and factors that influence survival in patients with oligometastasis (OM) are not well understood and have not been well described in large-scale studies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate overall progression-free survival (PFS), widespread progression (WSP) outcomes, and survival factors from a pooled data set of 1033 patients with OM treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Case series from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2016. The dates of analysis were April 2019 to May 2020. The setting was multi-institutional tertiary care hospitals. Participants were consecutive patients with 5 or fewer extracranial OMs whose primary tumor was treated curatively. EXPOSURE: Definitive SBRT. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, rate of WSP, patterns of failure, and factors altering OS. RESULTS: In the largest international OM case series to date (1033 participants) (mean age, 68.0 years [range, 18.0-94.3 years]; 601 [58.2%] men), 1416 SBRT courses were delivered to patients with 1 OM (596 [57.7%]), 2 OMs (245 [23.7%]), 3 OMs (105 [10.2%]), 4 OMs (55 [5.3%]), and 5 OMs (32 [3.1%]). The median follow-up was 24.1 months (range, 0.3-104.7 months), and the median OS was 44.2 months (95% CI, 39.2-48.8 months). The median PFS was 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.6-14.2 months), and the median time to WSP was 42.5 months (95% CI, 36.8-53.5 months). The OS rates were 84.1% (95% CI, 81.7%-86.2%) at 1 year, 56.7% (95% CI, 53.0%-60.2%) at 3 years, and 35.2% (95% CI, 30.1%-40.3%) at 5 years. The 3-year OS, PFS, and WSP rates were 56.7% (95% CI, 53.0%-60.2%), 23.0% (95% CI, 20.2%-25.9%), and 45.2% (95% CI, 41.4%-48.9%), respectively. The 5-year OS, PFS, and WSP rates were 35.2% (95% CI, 30.1%-40.3%), 14.8% (95% CI, 11.9%-17.9%), and 54.5% (95% CI, 49.8%-59.2%), respectively. At the time of first progression, 342 patients (33.1%) had recurrence of OM disease, and 230 patients (22.3%) underwent subsequent ablative therapies to all known metastatic sites. Multivariable analyses identified primary tumor type (hazard ratio [HR], 3.73; 95% CI, 1.75-7.94; P < .001 for breast; 5.75; 95% CI, 2.88-11.46; P < .001 for colorectal; 4.67; 95% CI, 2.12-10.31; P < .001 for kidney; 10.61; 95% CI, 5.36-20.99; P < .001 for lung; and 12.00; 95% CI, 6.06-23.76; P < .001 for other [with prostate being the reference group]), metachronous OM presentation more than 24 months since initial diagnosis (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.49-0.80; P < .001), metastases confined to the lung only (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.48-0.72; P < .001), and nodal or soft-tissue metastases only (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.26-0.90; P = .02) as survival factors. Sixty-six (6.4%) grade 3 or higher toxic effects were observed, including 1 (0.1%) grade 5 event. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found favorable long-term OS and WSP rates associated with extracranial OM ablated with SBRT; however, modest PFS rates were observed. A substantial proportion of patients with OM developed progressive disease and were treated with local ablation. Factors that can inform clinical decision-making and clinical trial design include primary tumor type, a metachronous presentation more than 24 months since diagnosis, and the site of OM presentation.";0
Establishment and Validation of Nomogram Model Integrated With Inflammation-Based Factors for the Prognosis of Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.;OBJECTS: Inflammation is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Tumor-associated inflammatory response plays a crucial role in enhancing tumorigenesis. This study aimed to establish an effective predictive nomogram based on inflammation factors in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 887 patients with advanced NSCLC between November 2004 and December 2015 and randomly divided them into primary (n = 520) and validation cohorts (n = 367). Cox regression analysis was used to identify prognostic factors for building the nomogram. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of the nomogram were determined using a concordance index (C-index), calibration plot, and decision curve analysis and were compared to the TNM staging system. RESULTS: The nomogram was established using independent risk factors (P < 0.05): age, TNM stage, C reaction protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR), and neutrophils (NEU). The C-index of the model for predicting OS had a superior discrimination power compared to that of the TNM staging system both in the primary [0.711 (95% CI: 0.675-0.747) vs 0.531 (95% CI: 0.488-0.574), P < 0.01] and validation cohorts [0.703, 95% CI: 0.671 -0.735 vs 0.582, 95% CI: 0.545-0.619, P < 0.01]. Decision curves also demonstrated that the nomogram had higher overall net benefits than that of the TNM staging system. Subgroup analyses revealed that the nomogram was a favorable prognostic parameter in advanced NSCLC (P < 0.05). The results were internally validated using the validation cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed nomogram with inflammatory factors resulted in an accurate prognostic prediction in patients with advanced NSCLC.;0
Comparison of nomogram with machine learning techniques for prediction of overall survival in patients with tongue cancer.;BACKGROUND: The prediction of overall survival in tongue cancer is important for planning of personalized care and patient counselling. OBJECTIVES: This study compares the performance of a nomogram with a machine learning model to predict overall survival in tongue cancer. The nomogram and machine learning model were built using a large data set from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program database. The comparison is necessary to provide the clinicians with a comprehensive, practical, and most accurate assistive system to predict overall survival of this patient population. METHODS: The data set used included the records of 7596 tongue cancer patients. The considered machine learning algorithms were logistic regression, support vector machine, Bayes point machine, boosted decision tree, decision forest, and decision jungle. These algorithms were mainly evaluated in terms of the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and accuracy values. The performance of the algorithm that produced the best result was compared with a nomogram to predict overall survival in tongue cancer patients. RESULTS: The boosted decision-tree algorithm outperformed other algorithms. When compared with a nomogram using external validation data, the boosted decision tree produced an accuracy of 88.7% while the nomogram showed an accuracy of 60.4%. In addition, it was found that age of patient, T stage, radiotherapy, and the surgical resection were the most prominent features with significant influence on the machine learning model's performance to predict overall survival. CONCLUSION: The machine learning model provides more personalized and reliable prognostic information of tongue cancer than the nomogram. However, the level of transparency offered by the nomogram in estimating patients' outcomes seems more confident and strengthened the principle of shared decision making between the patient and clinician. Therefore, a combination of a nomogram - machine learning (NomoML) predictive model may help to improve care, provides information to patients, and facilitates the clinicians in making tongue cancer management-related decisions.;0
Challenges of the current precision medicine approach for pancreatic cancer: A single institution experience between 2013 and 2017.;Recent research on genomic profiling of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has identified many potentially actionable alterations. However, the feasibility of using genomic profiling to guide routine clinical decision making for PDAC patients remains unclear. We retrospectively reviewed PDAC patients between October 2013 and December 2017, who underwent treatment at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and had clinical tumor next-generation sequencing (NGS) through commercial resources. Ninety-two patients with 93 tumors tested were included. Forty-eight (52%) patients had potentially curative surgeries. The median time from the tissue available to the NGS testing ordered was 229 days (interquartile range 62-415). A total of three (3%) patients had matched targeted therapies based on genomic profiling results. Genomic profiling guided personalized treatment for PDAC patients is feasible, but the percentage of patients who receive targeted therapy is low. The main challenges are ordering NGS testing early in the clinical course of the disease and the limited evidence of using a targeted approach in these patients. A real-time department level genomic testing ordering system in combination with an evidence-based flagging system for potentially actionable alterations could help address these shortcomings.;0
Development of a multiomics database for personalized prognostic forecasting in head and neck cancer: The Big Data to Decide EU Project.;"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in treatments, 30% to 50% of stage III-IV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients relapse within 2 years after treatment. The Big Data to Decide (BD2Decide) project aimed to build a database for prognostic prediction modeling. METHODS: Stage III-IV HNSCC patients with locoregionally advanced HNSCC treated with curative intent (1537) were included. Whole transcriptomics and radiomics analyses were performed using pretreatment tumor samples and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging scans, respectively. RESULTS: The entire cohort was composed of 71% male (1097)and 29% female (440): oral cavity (429, 28%), oropharynx (624, 41%), larynx (314, 20%), and hypopharynx (170, 11%); median follow-up 50.5 months. Transcriptomics and imaging data were available for 1284 (83%) and 1239 (80%) cases, respectively; 1047 (68%) patients shared both. CONCLUSIONS: This annotated database represents the HNSCC largest available repository and will enable to develop/validate a decision support system integrating multiscale data to explore through classical and machine learning models their prognostic role.";0
Adapting two American Decision Aids for Mild Traumatic Brain Injury to the Canadian Context Using the Nominal Group Technique.;"BACKGROUND: Decision aids are patient-focused tools that have the potential to reduce the overuse of head computed tomography (CT) scans. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to create a consensus among Canadian mild traumatic brain injury and emergency medicine experts on modifications required to adapt two American decision aids about head CT use for adult and paediatric mild traumatic brain injury to the Canadian context. METHODS: We invited 21 Canadian stakeholders and the two authors of the American decision aids to a Nominal Group Technique consensus meeting to generate suggestions for adapting the decision aids. This method encourages idea generation and sharing between team members. Each idea was discussed and then prioritised using a voting system. We collected data using videotaping, writing material and online collaborative writing tools. The modifications proposed were analysed using a qualitative thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one participants took part in the meeting, including researchers and clinician researchers (n = 9; 43%), patient partners (n = 3; 14%) and decision makers (n = 2; 10%). A total of 84 ideas were generated. Participants highlighted the need to clarify the purpose of the decision aids, the nature of the problem being addressed and the target population. The tools require sociocultural adaptations, better identification of their target population, better description of head CT utility, advantages and related risks, modification of the visual and written representation of the risk of brain injury and head CT use, and locally adapted, patient follow-up plans. CONCLUSIONS: This study based on a Nominal Group Technique identified several adaptations for two American decision aids about head CT use for mild traumatic brain injury to support their use in Canada's different healthcare, social, cultural and legal context. These adaptations concerned the target users of the decision aids, the information presented, and how the benefits and risks were communicated in the decision aids. Future steps include prototyping the two adapted decision aids, conducting formative evaluations with actual emergency department patients and clinicians, and measuring the impact of the adapted tools on CT scan use.";0
The challenge of sustainability in healthcare systems: cost of radiotherapy in the last month of life in an Italian cancer center.;PURPOSE: Cost evaluation is becoming mandatory to support healthcare sustainability and optimize the decision-making process. This topic is a challenge, especially for complex and rapidly evolving treatment modalities such as radiotherapy (RT). The aim of the present study was to investigate the cost of RT in the last month of life of patients in an Italian cancer center. METHODS: This was a retrospective study on a cancer population (N= 160) who underwent RT or only an RT planning simulation in an end of life (EOL) setting. The cost of RT procedures performed on patients was collected according to treatment status, care setting, and RT technique used. Costs were valued according to the sum of reimbursements relating to all procedures performed and assessed from the perspective of the National Health System. RESULTS: The total cost of RT in the last month of life was euro244,774, with an average cost per patient of euro1530. Around 7.7% and 30.3% of the total cost was associated with patients who never started RT or who discontinued RT, respectively, while the remaining 62.0% referred to patients who completed treatment. Costs associated with outpatient and inpatient settings represented 54.3% and 38.6% of the total cost, respectively. The higher average cost per patient for the never-started and discontinued groups was correlated with patients who had a poor ECOG Performance Status. CONCLUSION: Improved prognostic accuracy and a better integration between radiotherapy and palliative care units could be a key to a better use of resources and to a reduction in the cost of EOL RT.;0
Machine-Learning Models for Multicenter Prostate Cancer Treatment Plans.;"Clinical factors, including T-stage, Gleason score, and baseline prostate-specific antigen, are used to stratify patients with prostate cancer (PCa) into risk groups. This provides prognostic information for a heterogeneous disease such as PCa and guides treatment selection. In this article, we hypothesize that nonclinical factors may also impact treatment selection and their adherence to treatment guidelines. A total of 552 patients with intermediate- and high-risk PCa treated with definitive radiation with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) between 2010 and 2017 were identified from 34 medical centers within the Veterans Health Administration. Medical charts were manually reviewed, and details regarding each patient's clinical history and treatment were extracted. Support Vector Machine and Random forest-based classification was used to identify clinical and nonclinical predictors of adherence to the treatment guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). We created models for predicting both initial treatment intent and treatment alterations. Our results demonstrate that besides clinical factors, the center in which the patient was treated (nonclinical factor) played a significant role in adherence to NCCN guidelines. Furthermore, the treatment center served as an important predictor to decide on whether or not to prescribe ADT; however, it was not associated with ADT duration and weakly associated with treatment alterations. Such center-bias motivates further investigation on details of center-specific barriers to both NCCN guideline adherence and on oncological outcomes. In addition, we demonstrate that publicly available data sets, for example, that from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEERs), may not be well equipped to build such predictive models on treatment plans.";0
A Prognostic Predictive System Based on Deep Learning for Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.;BACKGROUND: Images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are crucial unstructured data for prognostic evaluation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We developed and validated a prognostic system based on the MRI features and clinical data of locoregionally advanced NPC (LA-NPC) patients to distinguish low-risk patients with LA-NPC for whom concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is sufficient. METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study included 3444 patients with LA-NPC from January 1, 2010, to January 31, 2017. A 3-dimensional convolutional neural network was used to learn the image features from pretreatment MRI images. An eXtreme Gradient Boosting model was trained with the MRI features and clinical data to assign an overall score to each patient. Comprehensive evaluations were implemented to assess the performance of the predictive system. We applied the overall score to distinguish high-risk patients from low-risk patients. The clinical benefit of induction chemotherapy (IC) was analyzed in each risk group by survival curves. RESULTS: We constructed a prognostic system displaying a concordance index of 0.776 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.746 to 0.806) for the internal validation cohort and 0.757 (95% CI = 0.695 to 0.819), 0.719 (95% CI = 0.650 to 0.789), and 0.746 (95% CI = 0.699 to 0.793) for the 3 external validation cohorts, which presented a statistically significant improvement compared with the conventional TNM staging system. In the high-risk group, patients who received induction chemotherapy plus CCRT had better outcomes than patients who received CCRT alone, whereas there was no statistically significant difference in the low-risk group. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework can capture more complex and heterogeneous information to predict the prognosis of patients with LA-NPC and potentially contribute to clinical decision making.;0
A nurse- and peer-led psycho-educational intervention to support women with gynaecological cancers receiving curative radiotherapy: The PeNTAGOn randomised controlled trial - ANZGOG 1102.;"OBJECTIVE: Radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer is associated with multiple adverse effects. This randomised controlled trial evaluated the impact of a combined nurse- and peer-led psycho-educational intervention on psychological distress, preparation for treatment, quality of life, psychosexual function, unmet needs and vaginal stenosis. METHODS: Eligible women had a confirmed diagnosis of gynaecological cancer, scheduled to receive radiotherapy with curative intent, aged >/=18 years, and able to read and write English. Participants randomly assigned one-to-one to either four nurse-led consultations plus four peer-led telephone sessions, or to usual care. Participants completed study measures at baseline, immediately before first radiotherapy (FU1), and four weeks (FU2), three (FU3), six (FU4), and 12 months (FU5) post radiotherapy. The primary outcomes were psychological distress at FU1 and FU2 measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Of 840 eligible participants, 625 were approached and 319 (51%) consented; 158 assigned to intervention, 160 to usual care with 1 withdrawing before randomisation. Between-groups differences for primary outcomes were trivial- and small-sized, (both p > 0.05). Notable effects on secondary outcomes favouring the intervention at FU2 included preparation for treatment (sensory/psychological concerns, d = 0.57; and procedural concerns, d = 0.52) and specific needs domains (sexuality needs, d = 0.38; and health system and information needs, d = 0.41). CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that a nurse- and peer-led intervention had a beneficial effect on psychological distress compared to usual care. However, improved treatment readiness and lower health system and sexuality needs indicate the intervention may have addressed outcomes known to be important to this population.";0
The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Genitourinary Cancer Care: Re-envisioning the Future.;"CONTEXT: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic necessitated rapid changes in medical practice. Many of these changes may add value to care, creating opportunities going forward. OBJECTIVE: To provide an evidence-informed, expert-derived review of genitourinary cancer care moving forward following the initial COVID-19 pandemic. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A collaborative narrative review was conducted using literature published through May 2020 (PubMed), which comprised three main topics: reduced in-person interactions arguing for increasing virtual and image-based care, optimisation of the delivery of care, and the effect of COVID-19 in health care facilities on decision-making by patients and their families. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Patterns of care will evolve following the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine, virtual care, and telemonitoring will increase and could offer broader access to multidisciplinary expertise without increasing costs. Comprehensive and integrative telehealth solutions will be necessary, and should consider patients' mental health and access differences due to socioeconomic status. Investigations and treatments will need to maximise efficiency and minimise health care interactions. Solutions such as one stop clinics, day case surgery, hypofractionated radiotherapy, and oral or less frequent drug dosing will be preferred. The pandemic necessitated a triage of those patients whose treatment should be expedited, delayed, or avoided, and may persist with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in circulation. Patients whose demographic characteristics are at the highest risk of complications from COVID-19 may re-evaluate the benefit of intervention for less aggressive cancers. Clinical research will need to accommodate virtual care and trial participation. Research dissemination and medical education will increasingly utilise virtual platforms, limiting in-person professional engagement; ensure data dissemination; and aim to enhance patient engagement. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic will have lasting effects on the delivery of health care. These changes offer opportunities to improve access, delivery, and the value of care for patients with genitourinary cancers but raise concerns that physicians and health administrators must consider in order to ensure equitable access to care. PATIENT SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has dramatically changed the care provided to many patients with genitourinary cancers. This has necessitated a transition to telemedicine, changes in threshold or delays in many treatments, and an opportunity to reimagine patient care to maintain safety and improve value moving forward.";0
Counteracting Chemoresistance with Metformin in Breast Cancers: Targeting Cancer Stem Cells.;Despite the leaps and bounds in achieving success in the management and treatment of breast cancers through surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, breast cancer remains the most frequently occurring cancer in women and the most common cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Systemic therapeutic approaches, such as chemotherapy, although beneficial in treating and curing breast cancer subjects with localized breast tumors, tend to fail in metastatic cases of the disease due to (a) an acquired resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug and (b) the development of intrinsic resistance to therapy. The existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) plays a crucial role in both acquired and intrinsic chemoresistance. CSCs are less abundant than terminally differentiated cancer cells and confer chemoresistance through a unique altered metabolism and capability to evade the immune response system. Furthermore, CSCs possess active DNA repair systems, transporters that support multidrug resistance (MDR), advanced detoxification processes, and the ability to self-renew and differentiate into tumor progenitor cells, thereby supporting cancer invasion, metastasis, and recurrence/relapse. Hence, current research is focusing on targeting CSCs to overcome resistance and improve the efficacy of the treatment and management of breast cancer. Studies revealed that metformin (1, 1-dimethylbiguanide), a widely used anti-hyperglycemic agent, sensitizes tumor response to various chemotherapeutic drugs. Metformin selectively targets CSCs and improves the hypoxic microenvironment, suppresses the tumor metastasis and inflammation, as well as regulates the metabolic programming, induces apoptosis, and reverses epithelial-mesenchymal transition and MDR. Here, we discuss cancer (breast cancer) and chemoresistance, the molecular mechanisms of chemoresistance in breast cancers, and metformin as a chemo-sensitizing/re-sensitizing agent, with a particular focus on breast CSCs as a critical contributing factor to acquired and intrinsic chemoresistance. The review outlines the prospects and directions for a better understanding and re-purposing of metformin as an anti-cancer/chemo-sensitizing drug in the treatment of breast cancer. It intends to provide a rationale for the use of metformin as a combinatory therapy in a clinical setting.;0
Prognostic nomogram for predicting survival in patients with high grade endometrial stromal sarcoma: a Surveillance Epidemiology, and End Results database analysis.;OBJECTIVE: High grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is a rare and highly malignant tumor that lacks a prognostic model. The aim of this study was to develop a prognostic nomogram predicting the overall survival of patients with high grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. METHODS: Clinical data for patients were derived from the Surveillance Epidemiology, and End Results database. Cox analysis and Akaike's information criterion were used to construct the nomogram. The concordance index, time dependent receiver operating characteristic curve, and calibration plot were used to evaluate the discriminative and calibrating capability. The net reclassification index, integrated discrimination improvement, and concordance index change were also compared between the nomogram and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage. Clinical benefit was evaluated using decision curve analysis. The patients were separated into groups with low and high nomogram risk scores. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis and Cox analysis were used to investigate the survival difference between the two groups. RESULTS: The training and validation cohorts had 461 and 195 patients, respectively. A nomogram that incorporated disease stage, age, surgery, lymph node status, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy for predicting overall survival was established and validated. The concordance index of the nomogram was 0.734 (0.708-0.761) in the training cohort and 0.705 (0.659-0.751) in the validation cohort. The calibration plots showed a favorable calibrating ability of the nomogram. The 1 year and 3 year time dependent receiver operating characteristic curves showed the better discriminative ability of the nomogram than the staging system. The concordance index change, net reclassification index, and integrated discrimination improvement also indicated a significantly (p<0.05) better predictive power of the nomogram over disease stage. Furthermore, decision curve analysis suggested that the nomogram was clinically useful and had a larger clinical net benefit than disease stage alone. Patients with a high risk score had distinctly poorer survival than those with low risk scores. CONCLUSIONS: A prognostic nomogram in patients with high grade endometrial stromal sarcoma exhibited favorable prognostic discrimination and survival prediction ability compared with FIGO stage.;0
Advanced Sandwich Composite Cores for Patient Support in Advanced Clinical Imaging and Oncology Treatment.;Ongoing advances in both imaging and treatment for oncology purposes have seen a significant rise in the use of not only the individual imaging modalities, but also their combination in single systems such as Positron Emission Tomography combined with Computed Tomography (PET-CT) and PET-MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) when planning for advanced oncology treatment, the most demanding of which is proton therapy. This has identified issues in the availability of suitable materials upon which to support the patient undergoing imaging and treatment owing to the differing requirements for each of the techniques. Sandwich composites are often selected to solve this issue but there is little information regarding optimum materials for their cores. In this paper, we presented a range of materials which are suitable for such purposes and evaluated the performance for use in terms of PET signal attenuation, proton beam stopping, MRI signal shading and X-Ray CT visibility. We found that Extruded Polystyrene offers the best compromise for patient support and positioning structures across all modalities tested, allowing for significant savings in treatment planning time and delivering more efficient treatment with lower margins.;0
A new standardized data collection system for brain stereotactic external radiotherapy: the PRE.M.I.S.E project.;"BACKGROUND: In recent years, novel radiation therapy techniques have moved clinical practice toward tailored medicine. An essential role is played by the decision support system, which requires a standardization of data collection. The Aim of the Prediction Models In Stereotactic External radiotherapy (PRE.M.I.S.E.) project is the implementation of systems that analyze heterogeneous datasets. This article presents the project design, focusing on brain stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). MATERIALS & METHODS: First, raw ontology was defined by exploiting semiformal languages (block and entity relationship diagrams) and the natural language; then, it was transposed in a Case Report Form, creating a storage system. RESULTS: More than 130 brain SRT's variables were selected. The dedicated software Beyond Ontology Awareness (BOA-Web) was set and data collection is ongoing. CONCLUSION: The PRE.M.I.S.E. project provides standardized data collection for a specific radiation therapy technique, such as SRT. Future aims are: including other centers and validating an extracranial SRT ontology.";0
Clinical and imaging findings in cervical cancer and their impact on FIGO and TNM staging - An analysis from the EMBRACE study.;"OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences in local tumour staging between clinical examination and MRI and differences between FIGO 2009, FIGO 2018 and TNM in patients with primary cervical cancer undergoing definitive radio-chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients from the prospective observational multi-centre study ""EMBRACE"" were considered for analysis. All patients had gynaecological examination and pelvic MRI before treatment. Nodal status was assessed by MRI, CT, PET-CT or lymphadenectomy. For this analysis, patients were restaged according to the FIGO 2009, FIGO 2018 and TNM staging system. The local tumour stage was evaluated for MRI and clinical examination separately. Descriptive statistics were used to compare local tumour stages and different staging systems. RESULTS: Data was available from 1338 patients. For local tumour staging, differences between MRI and clinical examination were found in 364 patients (27.2%). Affected lymph nodes were detected in 52%. The two most frequent stages with FIGO 2009 are IIB (54%) and IIIB (16%), with FIGO 2018 IIIC1 (43%) and IIB (27%) and with TNM T2b N0 M0 (27%) and T2b N1 M0 (23%) in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: MRI and clinical examination resulted in a different local tumour staging in approximately one quarter of patients. Comprehensive knowledge of the differential value of clinical examination and MRI is necessary to define one final local stage, especially when a decision about treatment options is to be taken. The use of FIGO 2009, FIGO 2018 and TNM staging system leads to differences in stage distributions complicating comparability of treatment results. TNM provides the most differentiated stage allocation.";0
Tracheal intubation in traumatic brain injury: a multicentre prospective observational study.;"BACKGROUND: We aimed to study the associations between pre- and in-hospital tracheal intubation and outcomes in traumatic brain injury (TBI), and whether the association varied according to injury severity. METHODS: Data from the international prospective pan-European cohort study, Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research for TBI (CENTER-TBI), were used (n=4509). For prehospital intubation, we excluded self-presenters. For in-hospital intubation, patients whose tracheas were intubated on-scene were excluded. The association between intubation and outcome was analysed with ordinal regression with adjustment for the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI variables and extracranial injury. We assessed whether the effect of intubation varied by injury severity by testing the added value of an interaction term with likelihood ratio tests. RESULTS: In the prehospital analysis, 890/3736 (24%) patients had their tracheas intubated at scene. In the in-hospital analysis, 460/2930 (16%) patients had their tracheas intubated in the emergency department. There was no adjusted overall effect on functional outcome of prehospital intubation (odds ratio=1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.79-1.28; P=0.96), and the adjusted overall effect of in-hospital intubation was not significant (odds ratio=0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.13; P=0.28). However, prehospital intubation was associated with better functional outcome in patients with higher thorax and abdominal Abbreviated Injury Scale scores (P=0.009 and P=0.02, respectively), whereas in-hospital intubation was associated with better outcome in patients with lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores (P=0.01): in-hospital intubation was associated with better functional outcome in patients with Glasgow Coma Scale scores of 10 or lower. CONCLUSION: The benefits and harms of tracheal intubation should be carefully evaluated in patients with TBI to optimise benefit. This study suggests that extracranial injury should influence the decision in the prehospital setting, and level of consciousness in the in-hospital setting.

FRoG: An independent dose and LET(d) prediction tool for proton therapy at ProBeam(R) facilities.;PURPOSE: Particle therapy is becoming increasingly available world-wide for precise tumor targeting, its favorable depth dose deposition, and increased biological damage to tumor tissue compared to conventional photon therapy. As demand increases for improved robustness and conformality, next-generation secondary dose calculation engines are needed to verify treatment plans independently and provide estimates for clinical decision-making factors, such as dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LET(d) ) and relative biological effectiveness (RBE). METHOD: FRoG (Fast dose Recalculation on GPU) has been installed and commissioned at the Danish Centre for Particle Therapy (DCPT). FRoG was developed for synchrotron-based facilities and has previously demonstrated good agreement with gold-standard Monte Carlo simulations and measurements. In this work, additions and modifications to FRoG's pencil beam algorithm to support the ion beam delivery with cyclotron-based technology as used at the DCPT, range shifter (RS) implementation, and robustness analysis methods are presented. FRoG dose predictions are compared to measurements and predictions of the clinical treatment planning system (TPS) Eclipse (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, United States of America, CA, v.13.7.16) in both homogenous and heterogeneous scenarios using a solid-water/water and a half-head anthropomorphic phantom, respectively. Additional capabilities of FRoG are explored by performing a plan robustness analysis, analyzing dose and LET(d) for ten patients. RESULTS: Mid-target measurements in spread-out Bragg Peaks (SOBP) were on average within -0.19% +/- 0.30% and </=0.5% of FRoG predictions for irradiations without and with RS, respectively. Average 3%/2mm 3D gamma-analysis passing rates were 99.1% for ~200 patient plan QA comparisons. Measurement with an anthropomorphic head-phantom yielded a gamma-passing rate >98%. Overall, maximum target differences in D(02%) of <2% between the TPS and FRoG were observed for patient plans. The robustness analysis study accounting for range, delivery, and positioning uncertainties revealed small differences in target dose and a maximum LET(d) VH(02%) (LET(d) received by 2% of the volume having dose larger than 1% of maximum dose) values below 10.1 keV/microm to the brain stem. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that auxiliary dose calculation systems like FRoG can yield excellent agreement to measurements comparable to clinical beam models. Through this work, application of FRoG as a secondary engine at third party cyclotron-based particle treatment facilities is now established for dose verification as well as providing further insight on LET(d) and variable RBE distributions for protons, currently absent from the standard clinical TPS.;0
Prognostic validation and treatment decision making of the 8(th) edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer pathological staging system for elderly women with early-stage breast cancer.;PURPOSE: To determine the prognostication and treatment decision making of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8(th) pathological staging system in elderly women (aged >/=65 years) with T1-2N0M0 breast cancer (BC). RESULTS: We included 67699 patients, and patients were restaged into stage IA (84.9%), IB (8.9%), and IIA (6.2%) using the 8(th) AJCC edition criteria. Overall, 69.4% and 30.6% of them underwent breast-conservation surgery (BCS) and mastectomy (MAST), respectively. In patients who received BCS, 30.3% of them underwent postoperative radiotherapy (RT). Patients with a higher pathological stage were more likely to receive MAST. The 5-year breast cancer-specific mortality rate was 2.2%, 6.5% and 13.7% in stage IA, IB, and IIA, respectively. Patients treated with BCS and RT had significantly lower risk of breast cancer-specific mortality compared to those treated with MAST or with BCS alone regardless of the pathological prognostic stages (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The 8(th) AJCC pathological prognostic staging system provides accurate risk stratification and impacts the treatment decision making for elderly women with early-stage BC. METHODS: We identified stage T1-2N0M0 BC patients using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Statistical analyses were used binomial logistic regression, and multivariable competing risk models in the Cox model framework.;0
Pathological response in children and adults with large unresected intermediate-grade or high-grade soft tissue sarcoma receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy with or without pazopanib (ARST1321): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.;"BACKGROUND: Outcomes for children and adults with advanced soft tissue sarcoma are poor with traditional therapy. We investigated whether the addition of pazopanib to preoperative chemoradiotherapy would improve pathological near complete response rate compared with chemoradiotherapy alone. METHODS: In this joint Children's Oncology Group and NRG Oncology multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial, we enrolled eligible adults (aged >/=18 years) and children (aged between 2 and <18 years) from 57 hospitals in the USA and Canada with unresected, newly diagnosed trunk or extremity chemotherapy-sensitive soft tissue sarcoma, which were larger than 5 cm in diameter and of intermediate or high grade. Eligible patients had Lansky (if aged </=16 years) or Karnofsky (if aged >16 years) performance status score of at least 70. Patients received ifosfamide (2.5 g/m(2) per dose intravenously on days 1-3 with mesna) and doxorubicin (37.5 mg/m(2) per dose intravenously on days 1-2) with 45 Gy preoperative radiotherapy, followed by surgical resection at week 13. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based system, in an unmasked manner, to receive oral pazopanib (if patients <18 years 350 mg/m(2) once daily; if patients >/=18 years 600 mg once daily) or not (control group), with pazopanib not given immediately before or after surgery at week 13. The study projected 100 randomly assigned patients were needed to show an improvement in the number of participants with a 90% or higher pathological response at week 13 from 40% to 60%. Analysis was done per protocol. This study has completed accrual and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02180867. FINDINGS: Between July 7, 2014, and Oct 1, 2018, 81 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the pazopanib group (n=42) or the control group (n=39). At the planned second interim analysis with 42 evaluable patients and a median follow-up of 0.8 years (IQR 0.3-1.6) in the pazopanib group and 1 year (0.3-1.6) in the control group, the number of patients with a 90% pathological response or higher was 14 (58%) of 24 patients in the pazopanib group and four (22%) of 18 patients in the control group, with a between-group difference in the number of 90% or higher pathological response of 36.1% (83.8% CI 16.5-55.8). On the basis of an interim analysis significance level of 0.081 (overall one-sided significance level of 0.20, power of 0.80, and O'Brien-Fleming-type cumulative error spending function), the 83.8% CI for response difference was between 16.5% and 55.8% and thus excluded 0. The improvement in pathological response rate with the addition of pazopanib crossed the predetermined boundary and enrolment was stopped. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were leukopenia (16 [43%] of 37 patients), neutropenia (15 [41%]), and febrile neutropenia (15 [41%]) in the pazopanib group, and neutropenia (three [9%] of 35 patients) and febrile neutropenia (three [9%]) in the control group. 22 (59%) of 37 patients in the pazopanib group had a pazopanib-related serious adverse event. Paediatric and adult patients had a similar number of grade 3 and 4 toxicity. There were seven deaths (three in the pazopanib group and four in the control group), none of which were treatment related. INTERPRETATION: In this presumed first prospective trial of soft tissue sarcoma spanning nearly the entire age spectrum, adding pazopanib to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy improved the rate of pathological near complete response, suggesting that this is a highly active and feasible combination in children and adults with advanced soft tissue sarcoma. The comparison of survival outcomes requires longer follow-up. FUNDING: National Institutes of Health, St Baldrick's Foundation, Seattle Children's Foundation.";0
"Canine Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (cAdMSCs) as a ""Trojan Horse"" in Vaccinia Virus Mediated Oncolytic Therapy against Canine Soft Tissue Sarcomas.";"Several oncolytic viruses (OVs) including various human and canine adenoviruses, canine distemper virus, herpes-simplex virus, reovirus, and members of the poxvirus family, such as vaccinia virus and myxoma virus, have been successfully tested for canine cancer therapy in preclinical and clinical settings. The success of the cancer virotherapy is dependent on the ability of oncolytic viruses to overcome the attacks of the host immune system, to preferentially infect and lyse cancer cells, and to initiate tumor-specific immunity. To date, several different strategies have been developed to overcome the antiviral host defense barriers. In our study, we used canine adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (cAdMSCs) as a ""Trojan horse"" for the delivery of oncolytic vaccinia virus Copenhagen strain to achieve maximum oncolysis against canine soft tissue sarcoma (CSTS) tumors. A single systemic administration of vaccinia virus-loaded cAdMSCs was found to be safe and led to the significant reduction and substantial inhibition of tumor growth in a CSTS xenograft mouse model. This is the first example that vaccinia virus-loaded cAdMSCs could serve as a therapeutic agent against CSTS tumors.";0
The gimbaled-head radiotherapy system: Rise and downfall of a dedicated system for dynamic tumor tracking with real-time monitoring and dynamic WaveArc.;A gimbaled-head radiotherapy device was developed by industry-academic collaborations, with a concept of robust structures whilst maintaining high flexibilities, and its clinical application started in 2008. The unique structures with multi-image guidance functions initiated 2 new treatment modalities. One is dynamic tumor tracking radiotherapy with real time monitoring (DTTRM), which enables 4-D radiotherapy without prolongation of radiotherapy treatment time. This treatment has become clinically feasible for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of lung cancers and liver tumors, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for pancreatic cancers. The second one is Dynamic WaveArc therapy (DWA), the non-coplanar versatility of the SBRT system by combining the gantry-ring synchronized rotation with dynamic multileaf collimator optimization. DWA opens the possibility to create patient-individualized treatment plans, allowing additional flexibility in organ at risk sparing while preserving dosimetric robust delivery. The clinical usefulness of the DWA has been preliminary shown for those tumors in the prostate, breast and skull base. Prospective clinical trials are under way with a support of the national funding of Japan for DTTRM and DWA, respectively. Marketing of the system was terminated in 2016 due to a commercial decision. However, lessons can be learned from the development process of this device that might be useful for those who have interests in new technologies and clinical applications in radiation oncology. This review article aims to summarize the developments and achievements of a gimbaled-head radiotherapy device with a focus on DTTRM and DWA.;0
Phase 1 Trial of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Neoadjuvant to Radical Prostatectomy for Patients With High-Risk Prostate Cancer.;PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) neoadjuvant to radical prostatectomy (RP) in a phase 1 trial. The primary endpoint was treatment completion rate without severe acute surgical complications. Secondary endpoints included patient-reported quality of life and physician-reported toxicities. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with nonmetastatic high-risk or locally advanced prostate cancer received 24 Gy in 3 fractions to the prostate and seminal vesicles over 5 days, completed 2 weeks before RP. Patients with pN1 disease were treated after multidisciplinary discussion and shared decision making. Patient-reported quality of life (International Prostate Symptom Score and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 26-item version questionnaires) and physician-reported toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03) were assessed before SBRT, immediately before surgery, and at 3-month intervals for 1 year. RESULTS: Twelve patients were enrolled, and 11 completed treatment (1 patient had advanced disease on prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography after enrollment but before treatment). There were no significant surgical complications. After RP, 2 patients underwent additional radiation therapy to nodes with androgen suppression for pN1 disease. Median follow-up after completion of treatment was 20.1 months, with 9 of 11 patients having a follow-up period of >12 months. Two patients had biochemical recurrence (prostate-specific antigen >/=0.05) within the first 12 months, with an additional 2 patients found to have biochemical recurrence after the 12-month period. The highest Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events genitourinary grades were 0, 1, 2, and 3 (n = 1, 4, 4, and 2, respectively), and the highest gastrointestinal grades were 0, 1, and 2 (n = 9, 1, and 1, respectively). At 12 months, incontinence was the only grade >/=2 toxicity. One and 2 of 9 patients had grade 2 and 3 incontinence, respectively. On the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (26-item version), the mean/median changes in scores from baseline to 12 months were -32.8/-31.1 for urinary incontinence, -1.6/-6.2 for urinary irritative/obstructive, -2.1/0 for bowel, -34.4/-37.5 for sexual function, and -10.6/-2.5 for hormonal. The mean/median change in International Prostate Symptom Score from baseline to 12 months was 0.5/0.5. CONCLUSIONS: RP after neoadjuvant SBRT appears to be feasible and safe at the dose tested. The severity of urinary incontinence may be higher than RP alone.;0
Corneal collagen cross-linking for bacterial infectious keratitis.;"BACKGROUND: Infectious keratitis is an infection of the cornea that can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, or parasites. It may be associated with ocular surgery, trauma, contact lens wear, or conditions that cause deficiency or loss of corneal sensation, or suppression of the immune system, such as diabetes, chronic use of topical steroids, or immunomodulatory therapies. Photoactivated chromophore for collagen cross-linking (PACK-CXL) of the cornea is a therapy that has been successful in treating eye conditions such as keratoconus and corneal ectasia. More recently, PACK-CXL has been explored as a treatment option for infectious keratitis. OBJECTIVES: To determine the comparative effectiveness and safety of PACK-CXL with standard therapy versus standard therapy alone for the treatment of bacterial keratitis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2019, Issue 7); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 8 July 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of PACK-CXL for bacterial keratitis. We included quasi-RCTs and CCTs as we anticipated that there would not be many RCTs eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors working independently selected studies for inclusion in the review, assessed trials for risk of bias, and extracted data. The primary outcome was proportion of participants with complete healing at four to eight weeks. Secondary outcomes included visual acuity, morphology, adverse events, and treatment failure at four to eight weeks. MAIN RESULTS: We included three trials (two RCTs and one quasi-RCT) in this review for a total of 59 participants (59 eyes) with bacterial keratitis. Trials were all single-center and were conducted in Egypt, Iran, and Thailand between 2010 and 2014. It is very uncertain whether PACK-CXL with standard antibiotic therapy is more effective than standard antibiotic therapy alone for re-epithelialization and complete healing (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 2.66; participants = 15). We judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low due to the small sample size and high risk of selection and performance bias. The high risk of selection bias reflects the overall review. Masking of participants was not possible for the surgical arm. No participant had a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/100 or better at eight weeks (very low certainty evidence). There is also no evidence that use of PACK-CXL with standard therapy results in fewer instances of treatment failure than standard therapy alone (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 4.98; participants = 32). We judged the certainty of evidence to be low due to the small sample size and high risk of selection bias. There were no adverse events reported at 14 days (low certainty evidence). Data on other outcomes, such as visual acuity and morphological characteristics, could not be compared because of variable time points and specific metrics. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence on the effectiveness of PACK-CXL for bacterial keratitis is of low certainty and clinically heterogenous in regard to outcomes. There are five ongoing RCTs enrolling 1136 participants that may provide better answers in the next update of this review. Any future research should include subgroup analyses based on etiology. A core outcomes set would benefit healthcare decision-makers in comparing and understanding study data.";0
Feasibility of intratumoral 165Holmium siloxane delivery to induced U87 glioblastoma in a large animal model, the Yucatan minipig.;Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain tumor leading to death in most of patients. It comprises almost 50-55% of all gliomas with an incidence rate of 2-3 per 100,000. Despite its rarity, overall mortality of glioblastoma is comparable to the most frequent tumors. The current standard treatment combines surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide. In spite of this aggressive multimodality protocol, prognosis of glioblastoma is poor and the median survival remains about 12-14.5 months. In this regard, new therapeutic approaches should be developed to improve the life quality and survival time of the patient after the initial diagnosis. Before switching to clinical trials in humans, all innovative therapeutic methods must be studied first on a relevant animal model in preclinical settings. In this regard, we validated the feasibility of intratumoral delivery of a holmium (Ho) microparticle suspension to an induced U87 glioblastoma model. Among the different radioactive beta emitters, 166Ho emits high-energy beta(-) radiation and low-energy gamma radiation. beta(-) radiation is an effective means for tumor destruction and gamma rays are well suited for imaging (SPECT) and consequent dosimetry. In addition, the paramagnetic Ho nucleus is a good asset to perform MRI imaging. In this study, five minipigs, implanted with our glioblastoma model were used to test the injectability of 165Ho (stable) using a bespoke injector and needle. The suspension was produced in the form of Ho microparticles and injected inside the tumor by a technique known as microbrachytherapy using a stereotactic system. At the end of this trial, it was found that the 165Ho suspension can be injected successfully inside the tumor with absence or minimal traces of Ho reflux after the injections. This injection technique and the use of the 165Ho suspension needs to be further assessed with radioactive 166Ho in future studies.;0
The Longitudinal Imaging Tracker (BrICS-LIT):A Cloud Platform for Monitoring Treatment Response in Glioblastoma Patients.;Glioblastoma is a common and aggressive form of brain cancer affecting up to 20,000 new patients in the US annually. Despite rigorous therapies, current median survival is only 15-20 months. Patients who complete initial treatment undergo follow-up imaging at routine intervals to assess for tumor recurrence. Imaging is a central part of brain tumor management, but MRI findings in patients with brain tumor can be challenging to interpret and are further confounded by interpretation variability. Disease-specific structured reporting attempts to reduce variability in imaging results by implementing well-defined imaging criteria and standardized language. The Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS) is one such framework streamlined for clinical workflows and includes quantitative criteria for more objective evaluation of follow-up imaging. To facilitate accurate and objective monitoring of patients during the follow-up period, we developed a cloud platform, the Brain Imaging Collaborative Suite's Longitudinal Imaging Tracker (BrICS-LIT). BrICS-LIT uses semiautomated tumor segmentation algorithms of both T2-weighted FLAIR and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI to assist clinicians in quantitative assessment of brain tumors. The LIT platform can ultimately guide clinical decision-making for patients with glioblastoma by providing quantitative metrics for BT-RADS scoring. Further, this platform has the potential to increase objectivity when measuring efficacy of novel therapies for patients with brain tumor during their follow-up. Therefore, LIT will be used to track patients in a dose-escalated clinical trial, where spectroscopic MRI has been used to guide radiation therapy (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03137888), and compare patients to a control group that received standard of care.;0
Prediction scoring system based on clinicohematologic parameters for cervical cancer patients undergoing chemoradiation.;"OBJECTIVE: A scoring system based on clinicohematologic parameters in cervical cancer patients receiving chemoradiation has not been reported to date. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of clinicohematologic parameters in patients with cervical cancer undergoing chemoradiation and to develop a prediction scoring system based on these results. METHODS: A total of 107 patients who received definitive chemoradiation for cervical cancer were enrolled in this study. The clinical data and hematologic parameters were retrospectively reviewed, and their prognostic value in predicting survival was analyzed. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) and the changes in these hematologic parameters (DeltaNLR, DeltaPLR, and DeltaLMR) between pre- and post-treatment were calculated to determine the specific value of these parameters for predicting patient survival. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 39.9 (range 2.7-114.6) months. The 3-year overall survival rate and progression-free survival rate were 80.9% (95% CI 72.7 to 90.0) and 53.4% (95% CI 44.1 to 64.8), respectively. The median progression-free survival was 67.5 months and the median overall survival was not reached. According to multivariable analysis, a DeltaNLR>/=0 was significantly associated with decreased progression-free survival (HR=2.91, 95% CI 1.43 to 5.94) and overall survival (HR=3.13, 95% CI 1.18 to 8.27). In addition, age (age <58.5 years; progression-free survival: HR=2.55, 95% CI 1.38 to 4.70; overall survival: HR=4.49, 95% CI 1.78 to 11.33) and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (-; progression-free survival: HR=2.49, 95% CI 1.40 to 4.43; overall survival: HR=3.02, 95% CI 1.32 to 6.90) were identified as predictors of poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: Both the age and FIGO stage, as clinical parameters, and the DeltaNLR, as a hematologic parameter, were independent prognostic factors for survival for cervical cancer patients treated with chemoradiation. Based on these results, we developed a risk score-based classification system for predicting survival.";0
Innovative decision support for scoliosis brace therapy based on statistical modelling of markerless 3D trunk surface data.;Recently markerless 3D scanning methods receive an increased interest for therapy planning and brace treatment of patients with scoliosis. This avoids repeated radiation known from standard X-Ray analysis. Several authors introduced the method of asymmetry distance maps in order to classify curve severity and progression. The current work extends this approach by statistical mean shape 3D models of the human trunk in order to classify patients. 50 patients were included in this study performing frontal X-ray and 3D scanning analysis. All patients were classified by a clinician according to their Cobb angle and spinal curve pattern (Augmented-Lehnert-Schroth ALS). 3D reconstructions of each patient trunk were processed in a way to elastically register a reference surface mesh with fixed number of data points. Mean 3D shape models were generated for each curve pattern. An asymmetry distance map was then calculated for each patient and mean shape model. Single patient 3D reconstructions were classified according to severity and ALS treatment group. Optimal sensitivity and specificity was 97%/39% thoracic and 87%/42% lumbar respectively for detecting mild and moderate-severe patients. Identifying a treatment group was possible for three combined groups allowing to support decisions during diagnosis and therapy planning.;0
Body composition changes in patients with head and neck cancer under active treatment: a scoping review.;BACKGROUND: Head and neck cancer patients have the second highest malnutrition prevalence, when compared with other oncological patients. They experience significant weight loss before diagnosis, during and after treatment, and even during the first year of follow-up. However, the prognostic value of weight loss depends on body mass index, and this may be associated with low skeletal muscle mass, masking its loss. Thus, weight loss itself poorly predicts outcome in head and neck cancer patients when compared with depleted skeletal muscle mass, illustrating the inadequacy of body mass index as an accurate method to reflect nutritional status. A synthesis is needed of the body composition changes occurring in head and neck cancer patients during treatment, as well as of the methods to assess it. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this scoping review is to examine and map the body composition changes in head and neck cancer patients under oncological treatment with curative intent. A further objective is to determine which methods are used to assess body composition in these patients. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Types of participants: The current review considered head and neck cancer patients, aged 18 years or older. CONCEPT: This scoping review considered all studies that focused on the body composition changes. CONTEXT: This scoping review considered the studies that evaluated the body composition changes in the context of treatment with curative intent. Surgical treatment approach was excluded to avoid excess heterogeneity in the data. Types of sources: This scoping review considered only published studies, with abstract available. SEARCH STRATEGY: A three-step search strategy was undertaken. This review was limited to studies published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese during 2000-2019. DATA EXTRACTION: The data extracted included author(s)/year of publication, aims and purpose of the study, sample size, study design, type of treatment, measurement points and component(s) of body composition evaluated, body composition assessment methods, and main results/findings. PRESENTATION OF RESULTS: Head and neck cancer patients suffer from serious loss of lean body mass, skeletal muscle, or free fat mass, after treatment compared with baseline. Further, nutritional deterioration is evident and occurs up to 8-12 months after treatment. Bioelectrical impedance analysis is one of the body composition assessment tools that has the great advantage for being available on a regular basis for assessment of body composition in head and neck cancer patients. However, it cannot be recommended for clinical decision making until further validation. CONCLUSION: Head and neck cancer patients experience a significant depletion of lean body mass, fat-free mass, and skeletal muscle, accompanied by body fat mass, while undergoing (chemo)radiotherapy. This can be demonstrated either by triceps skinfold thickness, bioelectrical impedance analysis, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, or computed tomography. This loss has a remarkable impact on their survival, on their quality of life, and on the risk for post-operative complications and may result in a reduced response to cancer treatment. Thus, body composition assessment should become an integral component of the care of head and neck cancer patients, beyond weight and body mass index, and should be carried out at different times throughout treatment.;0
Knowledge-based automated planning system for StereoElectroEncephaloGraphy: A center-based scenario.;Surgical planning for StereoElectroEncephaloGraphy (SEEG) is a complex and patient specific task, where the experience and medical workflow of each institution may influence the final planning choices. To account for this variability, we developed a data-based Computer Assisted Planning (CAP) solution able to exploit the knowledge extracted by past cases. By the analysis of retrospective patients' data sets, our system proposes a pool of trajectories commonly used by the institution, which can be selected to initialize a new patient plan. An optimization framework adapts those to the patient's anatomy by optimizing clinical requirements (e.g. distance from vessel, gray matter recording and insertion angle), and adapting its strategy based on the trajectory type selected.The system has been customized based on the data of a single institution. Two neurosurgeons, working in a high-volume hospital, have validated it by using 15 retrospective patient data sets, with more than 200 trajectories reviewed. Both surgeons considered ~81% of the optimized trajectories as clinically feasible (75% inter-rater reliability). Quantitative comparison of distance from vessels, insertion angle and gray matter recording index showed that the optimized trajectories reached superior or comparable values with respect to the original manual plans. The results suggest that a tailored center-based solution could increase the acceptance rate of the automated trajectories proposed.;0
Nomograms for predicting specific distant metastatic sites and overall survival of colorectal cancer patients: A large population-based real-world study.;BACKGROUND: This study aims to develop functional nomograms to predict specific distant metastatic sites and overall survival (OS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. METHODS: CRC case data were retrospectively recruited from a large population-based public dataset. Nomograms were developed to predict the probabilities of specific distant metastatic sites and OS of CRC patients. The performance of nomogram was evaluated with the concordance index (C-index), calibration curves, area under the curve (AUC), and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: A total of 142 343 cases were included in the current study. On the basis of univariate and multivariate analyses, clinicopathological features were correlated with specific distant metastatic sites and survival outcomes and were used to establish nomograms. The nomograms showed excellent accuracy in predicting specific distant metastatic sites. The C-indexes for the prediction of liver, lung, bone, and brain metastases were 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.81-0.83), 0.80 (95% CI, 0.78-0.81), 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79-0.86), and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.72-0.84), respectively. Then, a prognostic nomogram integrating clinicopathological features and specific distant metastatic sites was established to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS of CRC, with AUCs of 0.764 (95% CI, 0.741-0.783), 0.762 (95% CI, 0.745-0.781), and 0.745 (95% CI, 0.730-0.761), respectively. DCA showed that the prognostic nomogram had a better clinical application value than current TNM staging system. CONCLUSIONS: Based on clinicopathological features, original nomograms were constructed for clinicians to predict specific distant metastatic sites and OS of CRC patients. These models could help to support the postoperative personalized assessment.;0
Informed consent procedures in patients with an acute inability to provide informed consent: Policy and practice in the CENTER-TBI study.;"PURPOSE: Enrolling traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with an inability to provide informed consent in research is challenging. Alternatives to patient consent are not sufficiently embedded in European and national legislation, which allows procedural variation and bias. We aimed to quantify variations in informed consent policy and practice. METHODS: Variation was explored in the CENTER-TBI study. Policies were reported by using a questionnaire and national legislation. Data on used informed consent procedures were available for 4498 patients from 57 centres across 17 European countries. RESULTS: Variation in the use of informed consent procedures was found between and within EU member states. Proxy informed consent (N=1377;64%) was the most frequently used type of consent in the ICU, followed by patient informed consent (N=426;20%) and deferred consent (N=334;16%). Deferred consent was only actively used in 15 centres (26%), although it was considered valid in 47 centres (82%). CONCLUSIONS: Alternatives to patient consent are essential for TBI research. While there seems to be concordance amongst national legislations, there is regional variability in institutional practices with respect to the use of different informed consent procedures. Variation could be caused by several reasons, including inconsistencies in clear legislation or knowledge of such legislation amongst researchers.";0
Real-World Performance of the American Thyroid Association Risk Estimates in Predicting 1-Year Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Outcomes: A Prospective Multicenter Study of 2000 Patients.;"Background: One of the most widely used risk stratification systems for estimating individual patients' risk of persistent or recurrent differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines. The 2015 ATA version, which has increased the number of patients considered at low or intermediate risk, has been validated in several retrospective, single-center studies. The aims of this study were to evaluate the real-world performance of the 2015 ATA risk stratification system in predicting the response to treatment 12 months after the initial treatment and to determine the extent to which this performance is affected by the treatment center in which it is used. Methods: A prospective cohort of DTC patients collected by the Italian Thyroid Cancer Observatory web-based database was analyzed. We reviewed all records present in the database and selected consecutive cases that satisfied inclusion criteria: (i) histological diagnosis of DTC, with the exclusion of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features; (ii) complete data of the initial treatment and pathological features; and (iii) results of 1-year follow-up visit (6-18 months after the initial treatment), including all data needed to classify the estimated response to treatment. Results: The final cohort was composed of 2071 patients from 40 centers. The ATA risk of persistent/recurrent disease was classified as low in 1109 patients (53.6%), intermediate in 796 (38.4%), and high in 166 (8.0%). Structural incomplete responses were documented in only 86 (4.2%) patients: 1.5% in the low-risk, 5.7% in the intermediate-risk, and 14.5% in the high-risk group. The baseline ATA risk class proved to be a significant predictor of structural persistent disease, both for intermediate-risk (odds ratio [OR] 4.67; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.59-8.43) and high-risk groups (OR 16.48; CI 7.87-34.5). Individual center did not significantly influence the prediction of the 1-year disease status. Conclusions: The ATA risk stratification system is a reliable predictor of short-term outcomes in patients with DTC in real-world clinical settings characterized by center heterogeneity in terms of size, location, level of care, local management strategies, and resource availability.";0
Membrane-Associated Heat Shock Proteins in Oncology: From Basic Research to New Theranostic Targets.;Heat shock proteins (HSPs) constitute a large family of conserved proteins acting as molecular chaperones that play a key role in intracellular protein homeostasis, regulation of apoptosis, and protection from various stress factors (including hypoxia, thermal stress, oxidative stress). Apart from their intracellular localization, members of different HSP families such as small HSPs, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90 have been found to be localized on the plasma membrane of malignantly transformed cells. In the current article, the role of membrane-associated molecular chaperones in normal and tumor cells is comprehensively reviewed with implications of these proteins as plausible targets for cancer therapy and diagnostics.;0
Magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy feasibility in elderly cancer patients: proposal of the MASTER scoring system.;"BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are often excluded from advanced treatments owing to clinical complexity or frailty. Magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) represents a new frontier of radiotherapy delivery that can play an important role in the management of these patients. AIM: To assess MRgRT feasibility in elderly patients, describe their compliance with this treatment, and provide a scoring system for elderly patient selection. METHODS: Patients aged >75 years were enrolled. No restrictions on tumor site, staging, or treatment intent were applied. Patients underwent joint radiation oncology-geriatrics visits to assess the feasibility of MRgRT and to identify the most significant items (i.e. clinical variables) for the setup of a scoring system. The proposed scoring system was then internally validated on a prospectively enrolled cohort of elderly patients who were candidates for MRgRT. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled between February and March 2018. Their mean age was 81.4 +/- 3.4 years (range 75-88). Radiotherapy intent was curative in 26 patients; 14 patients were considered frail at screening tests before radiotherapy. Twelve items were identified as clinically significant for the setup of the MASTER score (MRI-Guided Radiotherapy Selection Elderly Score) score. Validation of the score showed 100% reliability, with no patient discharged after selection. CONCLUSIONS: MRgRT appears to be feasible in elderly patients and the MASTER score is proposed to support clinical decision-making in recommending elderly patients for this technology.";0
Impact of pelvic dimensions on anastomotic leak after anterior resection for patients with rectal cancer.;AIM: The impact of pelvis on the development of anastomotic leak (AL) in rectal cancer (RC) patients who underwent anterior resection (AR) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pelvic dimensions on the risk of AL. METHODS: A total of 1058 RC patients undergoing AR from January 2013 to January 2016 were enrolled. Pelvimetric parameters were obtained using abdominopelvic computed tomography scans. RESULTS: Univariate analyses showed that pelvic inlet, pelvic outlet, interspinous distance, and intertuberous distance were significantly associated with the risk for AL (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed that pelvic inlet and intertuberous distance were independent risk factors for AL (P < 0.05). Significant factors from multivariate analysis were assembled into the nomogram A (without pelvic dimensions) and nomogram B (with pelvic dimensions). The area under curve (AUC) of nomogram B was 0.72 (95% CI 0.67-0.77), which was better than the AUC of nomogram A (0.69, [95% CI 0.65-0.74]), but didn't reach a statistical significance (P = 0.199). Decision curve supported that nomogram B was better than nomogram A. CONCLUSION: Pelvic dimensions, specifically pelvic inlet and intertuberous distance, seemed to be independent predictors for postoperative AL in RC patients. Pelvic inlet and intertuberous distance incorporated with preoperative radiotherapy, preoperative albumin, conversion, and tumor diameter in the nomogram might provide a clinical tool for predicting AL.;0
Integrated Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Models for Standardizing Radiotherapy Structure Names.;The lack of standardized structure names in radiotherapy (RT) data limits interoperability, data sharing, and the ability to perform big data analysis. To standardize radiotherapy structure names, we developed an integrated natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) based system that can map the physician-given structure names to American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 263 (TG-263) standard names. The dataset consist of 794 prostate and 754 lung cancer patients across the 40 different radiation therapy centers managed by the Veterans Health Administration (VA). Additionally, data from the Radiation Oncology department at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) was collected to serve as a test set. Domain experts identified as anatomically significant nine prostate and ten lung organs-at-risk (OAR) structures and manually labeled them according to the TG-263 standards, and remaining structures were labeled as Non_OAR. We experimented with six different classification algorithms and three feature vector methods, and the final model was built with fastText algorithm. Multiple validation techniques are used to assess the robustness of the proposed methodology. The macro-averaged F 1 score was used as the main evaluation metric. The model achieved an F 1 score of 0.97 on prostate structures and 0.99 for lung structures from the VA dataset. The model also performed well on the test (VCU) dataset, achieving an F 1 score of 0.93 for prostate structures and 0.95 on lung structures. In this work, we demonstrate that NLP and ML based approaches can used to standardize the physician-given RT structure names with high fidelity. This standardization can help with big data analytics in the radiation therapy domain using population-derived datasets, including standardization of the treatment planning process, clinical decision support systems, treatment quality improvement programs, and hypothesis-driven clinical research.;0
Predicting poor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer: Model constructed using pre-treatment MRI features of structured report template.;PURPOSE: To develop a predictive model with pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the structured report template and clinical parameters for poor responses prediction after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (neoCRT) in locally advanced rectal cancers (LARC) patients. METHOD: Patients with clinicopathologically confirmed LARC (training and validation datasets, n = 100 and 71, respectively) were enrolled. Patients' clinical data were retrospectively collected. MRI findings of the structured report template were analysed. The tumour regression grade (TRG) system as proposed by Mandard et al was used. Poor response was defined as TRG 3-5. Univariate logistic regression analysis and a lasso regression model were performed to select the significant predictive features from the training set. A nomogram was constructed based on a multivariable logistic regression analysis. Calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness of the nomogram were assessed. The calibrative and discriminative ability of our model were compared with those of models including the tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and clinical factors. RESULTS: The MRI-reported T4b stage, MRI-reported extramural venous invasion (EMVI) positivity, MRI-detected number of positive mesorectal lymph nodes (LNs)>0, and preoperative oxaliplatin and capecitabine (CAPOX) chemotherapy regimen were incorporated into our nomogram. The nomogram showed good discrimination, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of 0.823 and 0.820 in the training and test sets, respectively, and good calibration in both datasets. The decision curve analysis confirmed that the nomogram was clinically useful. The calibrative and discriminative ability of our model were better than those models including the TNM stage and clinical factors. CONCLUSION: A nomogram based on pre-treatment MRI features of the structured report template and clinical risk factors has potential for use as a non-invasive tool to preoperatively predict poor responses in LARC patients after neoCRT.;0
A Quantitative Framework for Modeling COVID-19 Risk During Adjuvant Therapy Using Published Randomized Trials of Glioblastoma in the Elderly.;BACKGROUND: During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, contact with the healthcare system for cancer treatment can increase risk of infection and associated mortality. Treatment recommendations must consider this risk for elderly and vulnerable cancer patients. We re-analyzed trials in elderly glioblastoma (GBM) patients, incorporating COVID-19 risk, in order to provide a quantitative framework for comparing different radiation (RT) fractionation schedules on patient outcomes. METHODS: We extracted individual patient-level data (IPLD) for 1,321 patients from Kaplan-Meier curves from five randomized trials on treatment of elderly GBM patients including available subanalyses based on MGMT methylation status. We simulated trial data with incorporation of COVID-19 associated mortality risk in several scenarios (low, medium, and high infection and mortality risks). Median overall survival and hazard ratios were calculated for each simulation replicate. RESULTS: Our simulations reveal how COVID-19-associated risks affect survival under different treatment regimens. Hypofractionated RT with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) demonstrated the best outcomes in low and medium risk scenarios. In frail elderly patients, shorter courses of RT are preferable. In patients with methylated MGMT receiving single modality treatment, TMZ-alone treatment approaches may be an option in settings with high COVID-19-associated risk. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of COVID-19-associated risk models into analysis of randomized trials can help guide clinical decisions during this pandemic. In elderly GBM patients, our results support prioritization of hypofractionated RT and highlight the utility of MGMT methylation status in decision-making in pandemic scenarios. Our quantitative framework can serve as a model for assessing COVID-19 risk associated with treatment across neuro-oncology.;0
Perceptions of Clinical Trial Participation Among Women of Varying Health Literacy Levels.;"PURPOSE: To understand the perceptions of risk, benefit, and the informed consent process after enrolling in and completing a phase 2 clinical trial using intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for early-stage breast cancer, and to determine how perceptions varied based on women's health literacy levels. PARTICIPANTS &AMP; SETTING: 20 participants who had already completed a phase 2 IORT clinical trial for early-stage breast cancer at an academic medical center. METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted using structured interviews consisting of questions aimed to elicit responses from participants regarding experiences of informed consent and the research process. A validated brief health literacy questionnaire was used to determine health literacy levels of participants. The authors analyzed themes using inductive thematic analysis. FINDINGS: Women with lower levels of health literacy reported feeling confident enough in the provider to make the decision to enroll in the clinical trial during the initial consultation, and, in general, women reported relying heavily on provider recommendation for enrolling in the clinical trial. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Tailored approaches for patients with limited health literacy are needed during the clinical trial consent process. Additional longitudinal research with a larger sample size can extend study results and provide insight into the most effective way to modify the informed consent process for patients with limited health literacy.";0
A Subsolid Nodules Imaging Reporting System (SSN-IRS) for Classifying 3 Subtypes of Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma.;OBJECTIVES: To develop an imaging reporting system for the classification of 3 adenocarcinoma subtypes of computed tomography (CT)-detected subsolid pulmonary nodules (SSNs) in clinical patients. METHODS: Between November 2011 and October 2017, 437 pathologically confirmed SSNs were retrospectively identified. SSNs were randomly divided 2:1 into a training group (291 cases) and a testing group (146 cases). CT-imaging characteristics were analyzed using multinomial univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify discriminating factors for the 3 adenocarcinoma subtypes (pre-invasive lesions, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, and invasive adenocarcinoma). These factors were used to develop a classification and regression tree model. Finally, an SSN Imaging Reporting System (SSN-IRS) was constructed based on the optimized classification model. For validation, the classification performance was evaluated in the testing group. RESULTS: Of the CT-derived characteristics of SSNs, qualitative density (nonsolid or part-solid), core (non-core or core), semantic features (pleural indentation, vacuole sign, vascular invasion), and diameter of solid component (</=6 mm or >6 mm), were the most important factors for the SSN-IRS. The total sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of the SSN-IRS was 89.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 84.8%-92.4%), 74.6% (95% CI, 70.8%-78.1%), and 79.4% (95% CI, 76.5%-82.0%) in the training group and 84.9% (95% CI, 78.1%-90.3%), 68.5% (95% CI, 62.8%-73.8%), and 74.0% (95% CI, 69.6%-78.0%) in the testing group, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The SSN-IRS can classify 3 adenocarcinoma subtypes using CT-based characteristics of subsolid pulmonary nodules. This classification tool can help clinicians to make follow-up recommendations or decisions for surgery in clinical patients with SSNs.;0
External Validation of PATHFx Version 3.0 in Patients Treated Surgically and Nonsurgically for Symptomatic Skeletal Metastases.;BACKGROUND: PATHFx is a clinical decision-support tool based on machine learning capable of estimating the likelihood of survival after surgery for patients with skeletal metastases. The applicability of any machine-learning tool depends not only on successful external validation in unique patient populations but also on remaining relevant as more effective systemic treatments are introduced. With advancements in the treatment of metastatic disease, it is our responsibility to patients to ensure clinical support tools remain contemporary and accurate. QUESTION/PURPOSES: Therefore, we sought to (1) generate updated PATHFx models using recent data from patients treated at one large, urban tertiary referral center and (2) externally validate the models using two contemporary patient populations treated either surgically or nonsurgically with external-beam radiotherapy alone for symptomatic skeletal metastases for symptomatic lesions. METHODS: After obtaining institutional review board approval, we collected data on 208 patients undergoing surgical treatment for pathologic fractures at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 2015 and 2018. These data were combined with the original PATHFx training set (n = 189) to create the final training set (n = 397). We then created six Bayesian belief networks designed to estimate the likelihood of 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, and 24-month survival after treatment. Bayesian belief analysis is a statistical method that allows data-driven learning to arise from conditional probabilities by exploring relationships between variables to estimate the likelihood of an outcome using observed data. For external validation, we extracted the records of patients treated between 2016 and 2018 from the International Bone Metastasis Registry and records of patients treated nonoperatively with external-beam radiation therapy for symptomatic skeletal metastases from 2012 to 2016 using the Military Health System Data Repository (radiotherapy-only group). From each record, we collected the date of treatment, laboratory values at the time of treatment initiation, demographic data, details of diagnosis, and the date of death. All records reported sufficient follow-up to establish survival (yes/no) at 24-months after treatment. For external validation, we applied the data from each record to the new PATHFx models. We assessed calibration (calibration plots), accuracy (Brier score), discriminatory ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]). RESULTS: The updated PATHFx version 3.0 models successfully classified survival at each time interval in both external validation sets and demonstrated appropriate discriminatory ability and model calibration. The Bayesian models were reasonably calibrated to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center training set. External validation with 197 records from the International Bone Metastasis Registry and 192 records from the Military Health System Data Repository for analysis found Brier scores that were all less than 0.20, with upper bounds of the 95% confidence intervals all less than 0.25, both for the radiotherapy-only and International Bone Metastasis Registry groups. Additionally, AUC estimates were all greater than 0.70, with lower bounds of the 95% CI all greater than 0.68, except for the 1-month radiotherapy-only group. To complete external validation, decision curve analysis demonstrated clinical utility. This means it was better to use the PATHFx models when compared to the default assumption that all or no patients would survive at all time periods except for the 1-month models. We believe the favorable Brier scores (< 0.20) as well as DCA indicate these models are suitable for clinical use. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully updated PATHFx using contemporary data from patients undergoing either surgical or nonsurgical treatment for symptomatic skeletal metastases. These models have been incorporated for clinical use on PATHFx version 3.0 (https://www.pathfx.org). Clinically, external validation suggests it is better to use PATHFx version 3.0 for all time periods except when deciding whether to give radiotherapy to patients with the life expectancy of less than 1 month. This is partly because most patients survived 1-month after treatment. With the advancement of medical technology in treatment and diagnosis for patients with metastatic bone disease, part of our fiduciary responsibility is to the main current clinical support tools. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.;0
Mapping Patient Data to Colorectal Cancer Clinical Algorithms for Personalized Guideline-Based Treatment.;BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer in Germany, and the second and third most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and men, respectively. In this context, evidence-based guidelines positively impact the quality of treatment processes for cancer patients. However, evidence of their impact on real-world patient care remains unclear. To ensure the success of clinical guidelines, a fast and clear provision of knowledge at the point of care is essential. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to model machine-readable clinical algorithms for colon carcinoma and rectal carcinoma annotated by Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) based on clinical guidelines and the development of an open-source workflow system for mapping clinical algorithms with patient-specific information to identify patient's position on the treatment algorithm for guideline-based therapy recommendations. METHODS: This study qualitatively assesses the therapy decision of clinical algorithms as part of a clinical pathway. The solution uses rule-based clinical algorithms, which were developed based on the corresponding guidelines. These algorithms are executed on a newly developed open-source workflow system and are visualized at the point of care. The aim of this approach is to create clinical algorithms based on an established business process standard, the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), which is annotated by UMLS terminologies. The gold standard for the validation process was set by manual extraction of clinical datasets from 86 rectal cancer patients and 89 colon cancer patients. RESULTS: Using this approach, the algorithm achieved a precision value of 87.64% for colon cancer and 84.70% for rectal cancer with recall values of 87.64 and 83.72%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the automatic positioning of a patient on the decision pathway is possible with tumor stages that have a less complex clinical algorithm with fewer decision points reaching a higher accuracy than complex stages.;0
Development and validation of a radiomics model based on T2WI images for preoperative prediction of microsatellite instability status in rectal cancer: Study Protocol Clinical Trial (SPIRIT Compliant).;INTRODUCTION: Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second in females. Rectal cancer (RC) accounts for about 28% of all newly diagnosed CRC cases. The treatment of choice for locally advanced RC is a combination of surgical resection and chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. These patients can potentially be cured, but the clinical outcome depends on the tumor biology. Microsatellite instability (MSI) is an important biomarker in CRC, with crucial diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive implications. It is important to develop a noninvasive, repeatable, and reproducible method to reflect the microsatellite status. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been recommended as the preferred imaging examination for RC in clinical practice by both the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines. T2WI is the core sequence of MRI scanning protocol for RC. Radiomics, the high-throughput mining of quantitative image features from standard-of-care medical imaging that enables data to be extracted and applied within clinical-decision support systems to improve diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive accuracy, is gaining importance in cancer research.We proposed a hypothesis: A simple radiomics model based on only T2WI images can accurately evaluate the MSI status of RC preoperatively. OBJECTIVE: To develop a radiomics model based on T2WI images for accurate preoperative diagnosis the MSI status of RC. METHOD: All patients with RC were retrospectively enrolled. The dataset was randomly split into training cohort (70% of all patients) and testing cohort (30% of all patients). The radiomics features will be extracted from T2WI-MR images of the entire primary tumor region. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to select the most predictive radiomics features. Logistic regression models were constructed in the training/validation cohort to discriminate the MSI status using clinical factors, radiomics features, or their integration. The diagnostic performance of these 3 models was evaluated in the testing cohort based on their area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. DISCUSSION: This study will help us know whether radiomics model based on T2WI images to preoperative identify MSI status of RC.;0
Radiation Treatment, ATM, BRCA1/2, and CHEK2*1100delC Pathogenic Variants and Risk of Contralateral Breast Cancer.;"Whether radiation therapy (RT) affects contralateral breast cancer (CBC) risk in women with pathogenic germline variants in moderate- to high-penetrance breast cancer-associated genes is unknown. In a population-based case-control study, we examined the association between RT; variants in ATM, BRCA1/2, or CHEK2*1100delC; and CBC risk. We analyzed 708 cases of women with CBC and 1399 controls with unilateral breast cancer, all diagnosed with first invasive breast cancer between 1985 and 2000 and aged younger than 55 years at diagnosis and screened for variants in breast cancer-associated genes. Rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable conditional logistic regression. RT did not modify the association between known pathogenic variants and CBC risk (eg, BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant carriers without RT: RR = 3.52, 95% CI = 1.76 to 7.01; BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant carriers with RT: RR = 4.46, 95% CI = 2.96 to 6.71), suggesting that modifying RT plans for young women with breast cancer is unwarranted. Rare ATM missense variants, not currently identified as pathogenic, were associated with increased risk of RT-associated CBC (carriers of ATM rare missense variants of uncertain significance without RT: RR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.09 to 1.55; carriers of ATM rare missense variants of uncertain significance with RT: RR = 2.98, 95% CI = 1.31 to 6.80). Further mechanistic studies will aid clinical decision-making related to RT.";0
Imaging of intratumoral heterogeneity in high-grade glioma.;High-grade glioma (HGG), and particularly Glioblastoma (GBM), can exhibit pronounced intratumoral heterogeneity that confounds clinical diagnosis and management. While conventional contrast-enhanced MRI lacks the capability to resolve this heterogeneity, advanced MRI techniques and PET imaging offer a spectrum of physiologic and biophysical image features to improve the specificity of imaging diagnoses. Published studies have shown how integrating these advanced techniques can help better define histologically distinct targets for surgical and radiation treatment planning, and help evaluate the regional heterogeneity of tumor recurrence and response assessment following standard adjuvant therapy. Application of texture analysis and machine learning (ML) algorithms has also enabled the emerging field of radiogenomics, which can spatially resolve the regional and genetically distinct subpopulations that coexist within a single GBM tumor. This review focuses on the latest advances in neuro-oncologic imaging and their clinical applications for the assessment of intratumoral heterogeneity.;0
Cost of early-stage mycosis fungoides treatments in Spain.;"AIM: To identify the most common therapeutic options for the treatment of early-stage mycosis fungoides in Spain, quantify their associated healthcare resource use and costs. METHODS: After reviewing the literature, a panel of 6 Spanish clinical dermatologists validated the treatments and healthcare resource use through a structured questionnaire. Individual responses were collected, analyzed and presented into a face-to-face meeting in order to reach a consensus. Cost categories considered were: drug acquisition and administration, photo/radiotherapy session and maintenance, clinical follow-up visits and laboratory tests. Costs were expressed in euros from 2018. The Spanish National Health System perspective was considered, taking into account direct health costs and time horizons of 1, 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: Costs for the skin-directed treatments (SDT) assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months, were: Topical carmustine [euro6,593.36, euro19,780.09 and euro27,592.78]; Phototherapy with psoralens and ultraviolet A light (PUVA) [euro1,098.68, euro2,999.99 and euro3,187.60]; Narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy [euro1,657.47, euro4,842.10 and euro4,842.10]; Total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) [euro6,796.45, euro7,913.34 and euro7,913.34]. Cost for topical corticosteroids, being considered an adjuvant option, were euro17.16, euro51.49 and euro102.97. Costs for the assessed systemic treatments alone or in combination with SDT at 1, 3 and 6 months, were: Systemic retinoids [euro2,026.03, euro5,206.63 and euro7,426.42]; Systemic retinoids + PUVA phototherapy [euro3,066.50, euro8,271.26 and euro10,046.58]; Interferon alfa + PUVA phototherapy [euro1,541.09, euro5,167.57 and euro6,404.55]. CONCLUSION: According to the Spanish clinical practice, phototherapies in monotherapy were the treatments with the lowest associated costs regardless of the time horizon considered. TSEBT turned out as the treatment with the highest associated costs when considering 1 month. However, while considering 3 and 6 months the treatment with the highest associated costs was topical carmustine. The results of this analysis may provide critical information to measure the disease burden, to detect unmet medical needs and to advocate towards better treatments for this rare disease.";0
Machine learning helps identifying volume-confounding effects in radiomics.;Highlighting the risk of biases in radiomics-based models will help improve their quality and increase usage as decision support systems in the clinic. In this study we use machine learning-based methods to identify the presence of volume-confounding effects in radiomics features. Methods 841 radiomics features were extracted from two retrospective publicly available datasets of lung and head neck cancers using open source software. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) identified relations between radiomics and clinical outcomes (overall survival). Bootstrapping techniques with logistic regression verified features' prognostic power and robustness. Results Over 80% of the features had large pairwise correlations. Nearly 30% of the features presented strong correlations with tumor volume. Using volume-independent features for clustering and PCA did not allow risk stratification of patients. Clinical predictors outperformed radiomics features in bootstrapping and logistic regression. Conclusions The adoption of safeguards in radiomics is imperative to improve the quality of radiomics studies. We proposed machine learning (ML) - based methods for robust radiomics signatures development.;0
Exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis of (68)Gallium-PSMA PET/MRI-based imaging in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.;Men treated for prostate cancer with curative intent face a recurrence rate of up to 53% at 10 years. (68)Ga-PSMA imaging is a new technique that can more accurately stage cancer recurrences and facilitate personalised treatment. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of (68)Ga-PSMA PET/MRI for staging men with prostate cancer biochemical recurrence. A cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision-analytic model with Markov chains was constructed. (68)Ga-PSMA PET/MRI was compared with usual care in staging of men with suspected prostate cancer recurrence. Men with biochemical recurrence from a study in Brisbane, Australia (n = 30) provided key estimates for the model. The primary outcomes were health system costs and years of life (survival) over 10 years. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to address uncertainty in model estimates. On average, a strategy of (68)Ga-PSMA was expected to cost AU$56 961(US$39 426) and produce 7.48 life years compared with AU$64 499 (US$44 667) and 7.41 life years in usual care. Therefore, (68)Ga-PSMA was potentially cost saving (- AU$7 592 95% UI - $24 846, $7 825) (- US$5 258) and slightly more effective 0.07 life years (95% UI - 0.01, 0.16). The likelihood that (68)Ga-PSMA strategy was cost-effective at acceptable thresholds was 87%. The findings were sensitive to the lesion detection rate of the (68)Ga-PSMA strategy (52-75%) and the cost of follow up in usual care (AU$1 947 to $2 635). In this exploratory economic evaluation, using (68)Ga-PSMA PET/MRI to detect prostate cancer recurrence appears to be cost-effective relative to usual care.;0
ESR/ERS statement paper on lung cancer screening.;In Europe, lung cancer ranks third among the most common cancers, remaining the biggest killer. Since the publication of the first European Society of Radiology and European Respiratory Society joint white paper on lung cancer screening (LCS) in 2015, many new findings have been published and discussions have increased considerably. Thus, this updated expert opinion represents a narrative, non-systematic review of the evidence from LCS trials and description of the current practice of LCS as well as aspects that have not received adequate attention until now. Reaching out to the potential participants (persons at high risk), optimal communication and shared decision-making will be key starting points. Furthermore, standards for infrastructure, pathways and quality assurance are pivotal, including promoting tobacco cessation, benefits and harms, overdiagnosis, quality, minimum radiation exposure, definition of management of positive screen results and incidental findings linked to respective actions as well as cost-effectiveness. This requires a multidisciplinary team with experts from pulmonology and radiology as well as thoracic oncologists, thoracic surgeons, pathologists, family doctors, patient representatives and others. The ESR and ERS agree that Europe's health systems need to adapt to allow citizens to benefit from organised pathways, rather than unsupervised initiatives, to allow early diagnosis of lung cancer and reduce the mortality rate. Now is the time to set up and conduct demonstration programmes focusing, among other points, on methodology, standardisation, tobacco cessation, education on healthy lifestyle, cost-effectiveness and a central registry.;0
Therapeutic Potential of Plant Phenolic Acids in the Treatment of Cancer.;Globally, cancer is the second leading cause of death. Different conventional approaches to treat cancer include chemotherapy or radiotherapy. However, these are usually associated with various deleterious effects and numerous disadvantages in clinical practice. In addition, there are increasing concerns about drug resistance. In the continuous search for safer and more effective treatments, plant-derived natural compounds are of major interest. Plant phenolics are secondary metabolites that have gained importance as potential anti-cancer compounds. Phenolics display a great prospective as cytotoxic anti-cancer agents promoting apoptosis, reducing proliferation, and targeting various aspects of cancer (angiogenesis, growth and differentiation, and metastasis). Phenolic acids are a subclass of plant phenolics, furtherly divided into benzoic and cinnamic acids, that are associated with potent anticancer abilities in various in vitro and in vivo studies. Moreover, the therapeutic activities of phenolic acids are reinforced by their role as epigenetic regulators as well as supporters of adverse events or resistance associated with conventional anticancer therapy. Encapsulation of phyto-substances into nanocarrier systems is a challenging aspect concerning the efficiency of natural substances used in cancer treatment. A summary of phenolic acids and their effectiveness as well as phenolic-associated advances in cancer treatment will be discussed in this review.;0
A new prognostic score for disease progression and mortality in patients with newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma.;BACKGROUND: Although various prognostic models for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) have been developed, there is no consensus regarding the optimal prognostic index. We aimed to evaluate potential prognostic factors and construct a novel predictive model for PCNSL patients. METHODS: We enrolled newly diagnosed PCNSL patients between 2003 and 2015. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). The prognostic factors identified using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to develop a predictive model. We subsequently validated the prognostic model in an independent cohort. We also evaluated the validity of the existing scores: the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group (IELSG), the Nottingham/Barcelona (NB), and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center models (MSKCC). RESULTS: We identified 101 patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL at our center. Multivariate analysis showed that age >/=80, deep brain lesions, and ECOG >/=2 were independent risk factors of PFS. Assigning one point for each factor, we constructed a novel prognostic model, the Taipei Score, with four distinct risk groups (0-3 points). The performances of the Taipei Score in discriminating both PFS and OS in the training cohort were significant, and the score was validated in the external validation cohort. The IELSG, NB and MSKCC models had insufficient discriminative ability for either PFS or OS in both cohorts. CONCLUSION: The Taipei Score is a simple model that discriminates PFS and OS for PCNSL patients. The score may offer disease risk stratification and facilitate clinical decision-making.;0
Oxidative Stress-Induced DNA Damage and Apoptosis in Clove Buds-Treated MCF-7 Cells.;In recent decades, several spices have been studied for their potential in the prevention and treatment of cancer. It is documented that spices have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anticancer effects. The main mechanisms of spices action included apoptosis induction, proliferation, migration and invasion of tumour inhibition, and sensitization of tumours to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In this study, the ability of clove buds extract (CBE) to induce oxidative stress, DNA damage, and stress/survival/apoptotic pathways modulation were analysed in MCF-7 cells. We demonstrated that CBE treatment induced intrinsic caspase-dependent cell death associated with increased oxidative stress mediated by oxygen and nitrogen radicals. We showed also the CBE-mediated release of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic factors, signalling of oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage with modulation of cell antioxidant SOD (superoxide dismutase) system, and modulation activity of the Akt, p38 MAPK, JNK and Erk 1/2 pathways.;0
Cost-Effectiveness and Quality-Adjusted Survival of Watch and Wait After Complete Response to Chemoradiotherapy for Rectal Cancer.;BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) is the standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. There is interest in deescalating local therapy after a clinical complete response to CRT. We hypothesized that a watch-and-wait (WW) strategy offers comparable cancer-specific survival, superior quality-adjusted survival, and reduced cost compared with upfront TME. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to compare WW, low anterior resection, and abdominoperineal resection for patients achieving a clinical complete response to CRT. Rates of local regrowth, pelvic recurrence, and distant metastasis were derived from series comparing WW with TME after pathologic complete response. Lifetime incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) were calculated between strategies, and sensitivity analyses were performed to study model uncertainty. RESULTS: The base case 5-year cancer-specific survival was 93.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 91.5% to 94.9%) on a WW program compared with 95.9% (95% CI = 93.6% to 97.4%) after upfront TME. WW was dominant relative to low anterior resection, with cost savings of $28 500 (95% CI = $22 200 to $39 000) and incremental QALY of 0.527 (95% CI = 0.138 to 1.125). WW was also dominant relative to abdominoperineal resection, with a cost savings of $32 100 (95% CI = $21 800 to $49 200) and incremental QALY of 0.601 (95% CI = 0.213 to 1.208). WW remained dominant in sensitivity analysis unless the rate of surgical salvage fell to 73.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Using current multi-institutional recurrence estimates, we observed comparable cancer-specific survival, superior quality-adjusted survival, and decreased costs with WW compared with upfront TME. Upfront TME was preferred when surgical salvage rates were low.;0
Comparison of supervised machine learning classification techniques in prediction of locoregional recurrences in early oral tongue cancer.;"BACKGROUND: The proper estimate of the risk of recurrences in early-stage oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) is mandatory for individual treatment-decision making. However, this remains a challenge even for experienced multidisciplinary centers. OBJECTIVES: We compared the performance of four machine learning (ML) algorithms for predicting the risk of locoregional recurrences in patients with OTSCC. These algorithms were Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Boosted Decision Tree (BDT), and Decision Forest (DF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study cohort comprised 311 cases from the five University Hospitals in Finland and A.C. Camargo Cancer Center, Sao Paulo, Brazil. For comparison of the algorithms, we used the harmonic mean of precision and recall called F1 score, specificity, and accuracy values. These algorithms and their corresponding permutation feature importance (PFI) with the input parameters were externally tested on 59 new cases. Furthermore, we compared the performance of the algorithm that showed the highest prediction accuracy with the prognostic significance of depth of invasion (DOI). RESULTS: The results showed that the average specificity of all the algorithms was 71% . The SVM showed an accuracy of 68% and F1 score of 0.63, NB an accuracy of 70% and F1 score of 0.64, BDT an accuracy of 81% and F1 score of 0.78, and DF an accuracy of 78% and F1 score of 0.70. Additionally, these algorithms outperformed the DOI-based approach, which gave an accuracy of 63%. With PFI-analysis, there was no significant difference in the overall accuracies of three of the algorithms; PFI-BDT accuracy increased to 83.1%, PFI-DF increased to 80%, PFI-SVM decreased to 64.4%, while PFI-NB accuracy increased significantly to 81.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the best classification accuracy was achieved with the boosted decision tree algorithm. Additionally, these algorithms outperformed the DOI-based approach. Furthermore, with few parameters identified in the PFI analysis, ML technique still showed the ability to predict locoregional recurrence. The application of boosted decision tree machine learning algorithm can stratify OTSCC patients and thus aid in their individual treatment planning.";0
Characterisation and classification of oligometastatic disease: a European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer consensus recommendation.;Oligometastatic disease has been proposed as an intermediate state between localised and systemically metastasised disease. In the absence of randomised phase 3 trials, early clinical studies show improved survival when radical local therapy is added to standard systemic therapy for oligometastatic disease. However, since no biomarker for the identification of patients with true oligometastatic disease is clinically available, the diagnosis of oligometastatic disease is based solely on imaging findings. A small number of metastases on imaging could represent different clinical scenarios, which are associated with different prognoses and might require different treatment strategies. 20 international experts including 19 members of the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer OligoCare project developed a comprehensive system for characterisation and classification of oligometastatic disease. We first did a systematic review of the literature to identify inclusion and exclusion criteria of prospective interventional oligometastatic disease clinical trials. Next, we used a Delphi consensus process to select a total of 17 oligometastatic disease characterisation factors that should be assessed in all patients treated with radical local therapy for oligometastatic disease, both within and outside of clinical trials. Using a second round of the Delphi method, we established a decision tree for oligometastatic disease classification together with a nomenclature. We agreed oligometastatic disease as the overall umbrella term. A history of polymetastatic disease before diagnosis of oligometastatic disease was used as the criterion to differentiate between induced oligometastatic disease (previous history of polymetastatic disease) and genuine oligometastatic disease (no history of polymetastatic disease). We further subclassified genuine oligometastatic disease into repeat oligometastatic disease (previous history of oligometastatic disease) and de-novo oligometastatic disease (first time diagnosis of oligometastatic disease). In de-novo oligometastatic disease, we differentiated between synchronous and metachronous oligometastatic disease. We did a final subclassification into oligorecurrence, oligoprogression, and oligopersistence, considering whether oligometastatic disease is diagnosed during a treatment-free interval or during active systemic therapy and whether or not an oligometastatic lesion is progressing on current imaging. This oligometastatic disease classification and nomenclature needs to be prospectively evaluated by the OligoCare study.;0
Mammographic density is a potential predictive marker of pathological response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.;"BACKGROUND: Our aim is to study if mammographic density (MD) prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a predictive factor in accomplishing a pathological complete response (pCR) in neoadjuvant-treated breast cancer patients. METHODS: Data on all neoadjuvant treated breast cancer patients in Southern Sweden (2005-2016) were retrospectively identified, with patient and tumor characteristics retrieved from their medical charts. Diagnostic mammograms were used to evaluate and score MD as categorized by breast composition with the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 5th edition. Logistic regression was used in complete cases to assess the odds ratios (OR) for pCR compared to BI-RADS categories (a vs b-d), adjusting for patient and pre-treatment tumor characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 302 patients were included in the study population, of which 57 (18.9%) patients accomplished pCR following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The number of patients in the BI-RADS category a, b, c, and d were separately 16, 120, 140, and 26, respectively. In comparison to patients with BI-RADS breast composition a, patients with denser breasts had a lower OR of accomplishing pCR: BI-RADS b 0.32 (95%CI 0.07-0.1.5), BI-RADS c 0.30 (95%CI 0.06-1.45), and BI-RADS d 0.06 (95%CI 0.01-0.56). These associations were measured with lower point estimates, but wider confidence interval, in premenopausal patients; OR of accomplishing pCR for BI-RADS d in comparison to BI-RADS a: 0.03 (95%CI 0.00-0.76). CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of accomplishing pCR is indicated to be lower in breast cancer patients with higher MD, which need to be analysed in future studies for improved clinical decision-making regarding neoadjuvant treatment.";0
Postoperative standard chemoradiotherapy benefits primary glioblastoma patients of all ages.;BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most malignant tumor of the central nervous system. Several prediction models have been produced to aid in prognosis assessment. Age, a primary decision factor for prognosis, is associated with increased genomic alterations, however the exact link between increased age and poor prognosis is unknown. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to reveal the underlying cause of poor prognosis in elderly patients. METHODS: This study included data on 616 primary GBM tumor samples from the CGGA and TCGA databases and 41 nontumor brain tissue samples obtained from GSE53890. Hallmarks and clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated in both tumor and nontumor brain tissues. The association between choice of treatment regimen and age was measured using ANOVA and Student's t test. RESULTS: Age was a robust predictor of poor prognosis in glioma. No age-related hallmarks of cancer were detected, including pathological characteristics or mutations. However, treatment choice was strongly significantly different between old and young patients. Combined chemo-radiation therapy could benefit old and young GBM patients, however, old patients are currently less likely to choose it. CONCLUSION: The vast divergence in prognosis between young and old GBM patients is largely caused by choice of treatment rather than age-related tumor genomic characteristics. Postoperative standard radio- and chemotherapy provide strong benefits to primary glioblastoma patients of all ages.;0
Personalizing age-specific survival prediction and risk stratification in intracranial grade II/III ependymoma.;"BACKGROUND: Models for estimation of survival rates of patients with intracranial grade II/III ependymoma (EPN) are scarce. Considering the heterogeneity in prognostic factors between pediatric and adult patients, we aimed to develop age-specific nomograms for predicting 3-, 5-, and 8-year survival for these patients. METHODS: A total of 1390 cases (667 children; 723 adults) of intracranial grade II/III EPNs diagnosed between 1988 and 2015 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database for our study. Univariable and multivariable Cox analyses were employed to identify independent prognostic predictors. Age-specific nomograms were developed based on the results of multivariate Cox analyses. We also evaluated the performance of these predictive models by concordance index, calibration curves, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves, and decision curve analyses. RESULTS: Considerable heterogeneity in prognostic factors was highlighted between pediatric and adult patients. Age, sex, tumor grade, surgery treatment and radiotherapy were identified as significant predictors of overall survival for children, and age, tumor grade, tumor size, surgery treatment, and marital status for adult. Based on these factors, age-specific nomogram models were established and internally validated. These models exhibited favorable discrimination and calibration characteristics. Nomogram-based risk classification systems were also constructed to facilitate risk stratification in EPNs for optimization of clinical management. CONCLUSIONS: We developed the first nomograms and corresponding risk classification systems for predicting survival in patients with intracranial grade II/III EPN. These easily used tools can assist oncologists in making accurate survival evaluation.";0
A minimal modeling framework of radiation and immune system synergy to assist radiotherapy planning.;Recent evidence indicates the ability of radiotherapy to induce local and systemic tumor-specific immune responses as a result of immunogenic cell death. However, fractionation regimes routinely used in clinical practice typically ignore the synergy between radiation and the immune system, and instead attempt to completely eradicate tumors by the direct lethal effect of radiation on cancer cells. This paradigm is expected to change in the near future due to the potential benefits of considering radiation-induced antitumor immunity during treatment planning. Towards this goal, we propose a minimal modeling framework based on key aspects of the tumor-immune system interplay to simulate the effects of radiation on tumors and the immunological consequences of radiotherapy. The impacts of tumor-associated vasculature and intratumoral oxygen-mediated heterogeneity on treatment outcomes are ininvestigated. The model provides estimates of the minimum radiation doses required for tumor eradication given a certain number of treatment fractions. Moreover, estimates of treatment duration for disease control given predetermined fractional radiation doses can be also obtained. Although theoretical in nature, this study motivates the development and establishment of immune-based decision-support tools in radiotherapy planning.;0
Cost-effectiveness of chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy versus chemoradiation alone in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.;BACKGROUND: Standard treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer usually includes a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), recent studies have indicated that esophagectomy after chemoradiation does not significantly improve survival but may reduce recurrence at the cost of treatment-related mortality. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of chemoradiation with and without esophagectomy. METHODS: We developed a decision tree and Markov model to compare chemoradiation therapy alone (CRT) versus chemoradiation plus surgery (CRT+S) in a cohort of 57-year-old male patients with esophageal SCC, over 25 years. We used information on survival, cancer recurrence, and side effects from a Cochrane meta-analysis of two randomized trials. Societal utility values and costs of cancer care (2017, USD) were from medical literature. To test robustness, we conducted deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). RESULTS: In our base scenario, CRT resulted in less cost for more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to CRT+S ($154 082 for 1.32 QALYs/patient versus $165 035 for 1.30 QALYs/patient, respectively). In DSA, changes resulted in scenarios where CRT+S is cost-effective at thresholds between $100 000-$150 000/QALY. In PSA, CRT+S was dominant 17.9% and cost-effective at willingness-to-pay of $150 000/QALY 38.9% of the time, and CRT was dominant 30.6% and cost-effective 61.1% of the time. This indicates that while CRT would be preferred most of the time, variation in parameters may change cost-effectiveness outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that more data is needed regarding the clinical benefits of CRT+S for treatment of localized esophageal SCC, although CRT should be cautiously preferred.;0
EAU-ESMO consensus statements on the management of advanced and variant bladder cancer-an international collaborative multi-stakeholder effort: under the auspices of the EAU and ESMO Guidelines Committeesdagger.;"BACKGROUND: Although guidelines exist for advanced and variant bladder cancer management, evidence is limited/conflicting in some areas and the optimal approach remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To bring together a large multidisciplinary group of experts to develop consensus statements on controversial topics in bladder cancer management. DESIGN: A steering committee compiled proposed statements regarding advanced and variant bladder cancer management which were assessed by 113 experts in a Delphi survey. Statements not reaching consensus were reviewed; those prioritised were revised by a panel of 45 experts before voting during a consensus conference. SETTING: Online Delphi survey and consensus conference. PARTICIPANTS: The European Association of Urology (EAU), the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), experts in bladder cancer management. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Statements were ranked by experts according to their level of agreement: 1-3 (disagree), 4-6 (equivocal), 7-9 (agree). A priori (level 1) consensus was defined as >/=70% agreement and </=15% disagreement, or vice versa. In the Delphi survey, a second analysis was restricted to stakeholder group(s) considered to have adequate expertise relating to each statement (to achieve level 2 consensus). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 116 statements were included in the Delphi survey. Of these, 33 (28%) statements achieved level 1 consensus and 49 (42%) statements achieved level 1 or 2 consensus. At the consensus conference, 22 of 27 (81%) statements achieved consensus. These consensus statements provide further guidance across a broad range of topics, including the management of variant histologies, the role/limitations of prognostic biomarkers in clinical decision making, bladder preservation strategies, modern radiotherapy techniques, the management of oligometastatic disease and the evolving role of checkpoint inhibitor therapy in metastatic disease. CONCLUSIONS: These consensus statements provide further guidance on controversial topics in advanced and variant bladder cancer management until a time where further evidence is available to guide our approach.";0
Prognosis viewing for nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy: application of nomogram and decision curve analysis.;OBJECTIVE: To view and evaluate the prognosis factors in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy using nomogram and decision curve analysis (DCA). METHODS: Based on a primary cohort comprising consecutive patients with newly confirmed NPC (n = 1140) treated between January 2014 and December 2015, we identified independent prognostic factors of overall survival (OS) to establish a nomogram. The model was assessed by bootstrap internal validation and external validation in an independent validation cohort of 460 patients treated between January 2013 and December 2013. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability were measured by calibration curve, concordance index (C-index) and risk-group stratification. The clinical usefulness was assessed by DCA. RESULTS: The nomogram incorporated T-stage, N-stage, age, concurrent chemotherapy and primary tumour volume (PTV). The calibration curve presented good agreement for between the nomogram-predicted OS and the actual measured survival probability in both the primary and validation cohorts. The model showed good discrimination with a C-index of 0.741 in the primary cohort and 0.762 in the validation cohort. The survival curves of different risk-groups were separated clearly. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the nomogram provided a higher net benefit (NB) across a wider reasonable range of threshold probabilities for predicting OS. CONCLUSION: This study presents a predictive nomogram model with accurate prediction and independent discrimination ability compared with combination of T-stage and N-stage. The results of DCA supported the point that PTV can help improve the prognostic ability of T-stage and should be added to the TNM staging system.;0
Predicting Prostate Cancer Death with Different Pretreatment Risk Stratification Tools: A Head-to-head Comparison in a Nationwide Cohort Study.;"BACKGROUND: Numerous pretreatment risk classification tools are available for prostate cancer. Which tool is best in predicting prostate cancer death is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To systematically compare the prognostic performance of the most commonly used pretreatment risk stratification tools for prostate cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A nationwide cohort study was conducted, including 154 811 men in Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe) 4.0 diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer during 1998-2016 and followed through 2016. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We compared the D'Amico, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), European Association of Urology (EAU), Genito-Urinary Radiation Oncologists of Canada (GUROC), American Urological Association (AUA), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and Cambridge Prognostic Groups (CPG) risk group systems; the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score; and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram in predicting prostate cancer death by estimating the concordance index (C-index) and the observed versus predicted cumulative incidences at different follow-up times. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 139 515 men were included in the main analysis, of whom 15 961 died from prostate cancer during follow-up. The C-index at 10 yr of follow-up ranged from 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72-0.73) to 0.81 (95% CI: 0.80-0.81) across the compared tools. The MSKCC nomogram (C-index: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.80-0.81), CAPRA score (C-index: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.79-0.81), and CPG system (C-index: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.78-0.79) performed the best. The order of performance between the tools remained in analyses stratified by primary treatment and year of diagnosis. The predicted cumulative incidences were close to the observed ones, with some underestimation at 5 yr. It is a limitation that the study was conducted solely in a Swedish setting (ie, case mix). CONCLUSIONS: The MSKCC nomogram, CAPRA score, and CPG risk grouping system performed better in discriminating prostate cancer death than the D'Amico and D'Amico-derived systems (NICE, GUROC, EAU, AUA, and NCCN). Use of these tools may improve clinical decision making. PATIENT SUMMARY: There are numerous pretreatment risk classification tools that can aid treatment decision for prostate cancer. We systematically compared the prognostic performance of the most commonly used tools in a large cohort of Swedish men with prostate cancer. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram, Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score, and Cambridge Prognostic Groups performed best in predicting prostate cancer death. The use of these tools may improve treatment decisions.";0
Investigation of a Novel Decision Support Metric for Head and Neck Adaptive Radiation Therapy Using a Real-Time In Vivo Portal Dosimetry System.;In adaptive radiation therapy of head and neck cancer, any significant anatomical changes observed are used to adapt the treatment plan to maintain target coverage without elevating the risk of xerostomia. However, the additional resources required for adaptive radiation therapy pose a challenge for broad-based implementation. It is hypothesized that a change in transit fluence is associated with volumetric change in the vicinity of the target and therefore can be used as a decision support metric for adaptive radiation therapy. This was evaluated by comparing the fluence with volumetric changes in 12 patients. Transit fluence was measured by an in vivo portal dosimetry system. Weekly cone beam computed tomography was used to determine volume change in the rectangular region of interest from condyloid process to C6. The integrated transit fluence through the region of interest on the day of the cone beam computed tomography scan was calculated with the first treatment as the baseline. The correlation between fluence change and volume change was determined. A logistic regression model was also used to associate the 5% region of interest volume reduction replanning trigger point and the fluence change. The model was assessed by a chi-square test. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was also determined. A total of 46 pairs of measurements were obtained. The correlation between fluence and volumetric changes was found to be -0.776 (P value <.001). The negative correlation is attributed to the increase in the photon fluence transport resulting from the volume reduction. The chi-square of the logistic regression was found to be 17.4 (P value <.001). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was found to be 0.88. Results indicate the change in transit fluence, which can be measured without consuming clinical resources or requiring additional time in the treatment room, can be used as a decision support metric for adaptive therapy.;0
Opioid Prescribing Safety Measures in Medicaid Enrollees With and Without Cancer.;INTRODUCTION: Opioid prescribing safety among individuals with cancer is poorly understood. This study estimates the prevalence of Pharmacy Quality Alliance opioid measures among individuals with cancer undergoing or not undergoing active treatment versus those without cancer. METHODS: Pennsylvania Medicaid data (2016) were analyzed in 2018 to identify adults aged 18-64 years with and without cancer diagnoses who had 2 or more opioid prescriptions. Active cancer treatment, defined as having chemotherapy, radiotherapy, cancer surgery, or hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of cancer, was evaluated from October 2015 to December 2016 allowing a >/=3-month look-back period for cancer diagnoses observed in the first quarter of 2016. Opioid dosages (>120 morphine milligram equivalents for >/=90 consecutive days), multiple providers (4 or more prescribers and 4 or more pharmacies), and opioid and benzodiazepines overlapping >/=30 days were evaluated. RESULTS: The sample with opioid prescriptions included 111,491 enrollees without cancer diagnoses and 12,819 with cancer, 58.8% of whom were not in active cancer treatment. Among enrollees undergoing cancer treatment, with cancer but not in active treatment, and without cancer, the prevalence of high morphine milligram equivalents was 7.1%, 6.0%, and 4.7% (p<0.001), respectively. The corresponding prevalence of multiple providers was 6.7%, 4.1%, and 3.4% (p<0.001). Concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions occurred in 28.6%, 30.5%, and 26.8% (p<0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with cancer, regardless of treatment status, had higher-risk opioid use based on Pharmacy Quality Alliance measures versus those without cancer. Their systematic exclusion from opioid quality surveillance could create missed opportunities to identify patients at high risk of adverse opioid-related outcomes.;0
The impact of chest computed tomography and chest radiography on clinical management of cystic fibrosis lung disease.;BACKGROUND: Recent standards of care mention chest radiography (CR) but not chest computed tomography (CT) in routine annual follow-up of children with cystic fibrosis (CF). To minimise radiation risk, CT or CR should only be performed if they impact clinical decision making. We investigated whether in addition to a wide range of commonly used clinical parameters, chest CT and/or CR in routine follow-up of CF patients influence clinical decisions. METHODS: 36 web based clinical vignettes (i.e. case simulations) were designed using clinical data from patients aged 8-18years, randomly selected from two CF centres in The Netherlands. In a randomized cross-over design, clinicians assessed eight vignettes and suggested therapeutic/diagnostic management on two occasions, with a ten-week interval. Radiological information (CT or CR) was included at only one of the two assessments, in random order. Any differences in management could be attributed to information from CT or CR, and were compared by McNemar analysis. RESULTS: 44 European and Australian clinicians completed a total of 143 CT vignette pairs and 167 CR vignette pairs. CT was associated with a significant increase in antifungal treatment (Risk Ratio (RR) 2.8 (1.3-6.0, p=.02)), bronchoscopies (RR 1.6 (1.1-2.5, p=.04)), mycobacterial cultures (RR 1.3 (1.0-1.5, p=.02)), and 'need for hospitalization' (i.e. intravenous antibiotics and/or bronchoscopy) (RR 1.4 (1.0-1.9, p=.03)). CR led to a significant increase in inhaled antibiotics only (RR 1.3 (1.0-1.6, p=.04)). CONCLUSIONS: CT but not CR, at routine biennial follow-up was associated with several changes in treatment and/or diagnostic testing, including the need for hospitalization.;0
Using Artificial Intelligence to Improve the Quality and Safety of Radiation Therapy.;"Within artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML) efforts in radiation oncology have augmented the transition from generalized to personalized treatment delivery. Although their impact on quality and safety of radiation therapy has been limited, they are increasingly being used throughout radiation therapy workflows. Various data-driven approaches have been used for outcome prediction, CT simulation, clinical decision support, knowledge-based planning, adaptive radiation therapy, plan validation, machine quality assurance, and process quality assurance; however, there are many challenges that need to be addressed with the creation and usage of ML algorithms as well as the interpretation and dissemination of findings. In this review, the authors present current applications of ML in radiation oncology quality and safety initiatives, discuss challenges faced by the radiation oncology community, and suggest future directions.";0
Personalized Breast Cancer Treatments Using Artificial Intelligence in Radiomics and Pathomics.;"Progress in computing power and advances in medical imaging over recent decades have culminated in new opportunities for artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, and using radiomics to facilitate clinical decision-making. These opportunities are growing in medical specialties, such as radiology, pathology, and oncology. As medical imaging and pathology are becoming increasingly digitized, it is recently recognized that harnessing data from digital images can yield parameters that reflect the underlying biology and physiology of various malignancies. This greater understanding of the behaviour of cancer can potentially improve on therapeutic strategies. In addition, the use of AI is particularly appealing in oncology to facilitate the detection of malignancies, to predict the likelihood of tumor response to treatments, and to prognosticate the patients' risk of cancer-related mortality. AI will be critical for identifying candidate biomarkers from digital imaging and developing robust and reliable predictive models. These models will be used to personalize oncologic treatment strategies, and identify confounding variables that are related to the complex biology of tumors and diversity of patient-related factors (ie, mining ""big data""). This commentary describes the growing body of work focussed on AI for precision oncology. Advances in AI-driven computer vision and machine learning are opening new pathways that can potentially impact patient outcomes through response-guided adaptive treatments and targeted therapies based on radiomic and pathomic analysis.";0
A pilot study of a smartphone-based monitoring intervention on head and neck cancer patients undergoing concurrent chemo-radiotherapy.;BACKGROUND: Multidisciplinary treatment for head and neck carcinoma offers the best curative results but generates acute toxicities, which negatively affect both patients' quality of life and treatment compliance. Usually, the patient's clinical condition is recorded during scheduled, time-limited office visits and patients might forget to discuss symptoms occurred weeks before. They could also have difficulties contacting their clinicians outside of these limited encounters. Technology-based interventions for oncological patients have already been proved to encourage accurate symptoms report through regular inquiries of their clinical conditions. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work is to present the results of a pilot study about the assessment of a novel mobile application for reporting clinical parameters, quality of life, and symptoms of home patients affected by head and neck carcinoma, during chemo-radiotherapy and the subsequent follow-up period. Results will inform app designers about the necessary modifications to face a full-scale trial. METHODS: Ten patients used the app for the foreseen period (up to 65 days, median 50.5), at the end of which they answered a paper questionnaire addressing user satisfaction with the app. The questionnaire included 8 questions and a free text comment field. Patients were followed by three clinicians, who also answered a similar paper questionnaire at the end of the pilot study. Questionnaires total score ranged 0-25 and a threshold of 16 was set in the study protocol to represent an overall positive outcome. However, to consider the individual constructs, questions about usability, perceived usefulness and user acceptance were also analyzed separately, and association among them was investigated. Finally, the feasibility of the intervention was analyzed in terms of the actual use of the app, i.e. dropout rates and compliance with the required data input. Statistics were only performed on patients' data, due to the small number of doctors involved in the study. RESULTS: The median of the total score per patient was 18.5 (interquartile range 11.2-20.5), and per doctor was 16 (range 11-20), thus showing a positive overall satisfaction with the app. Concerning patients, only 4 out of a total of 80 answers (10 patientsx8 questions) expressed a definite negative feeling. Perceived usefulness was a critical issue for some patients. It was positively correlated with usability, and both aspects were independent predictors of acceptance. Feasibility was demonstrated by the low percentage of dropouts (9%) and noncompliance with assignments (10%). A significant (p=0.007) negative correlation between the severity of reported symptoms and the EuroQoL questionnaire scores was found, supporting the consistency of the entered data. Free comments were reported by 6 Patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study was meant to explore the context of outpatients' remote monitoring through the collection of patient-reported outcomes. The intervention for a proactive approach to symptoms monitoring in curatively treated head and neck cancer patients resulted feasible and acceptable by both patients and oncologists. The study revealed a criticality on the perceived usefulness, but, at the same time, the patients' comments suggested how to improve this aspect. Further actions will need to focus on measuring the impact of HeNeA on the process of care and on the health outcomes.;0
Evaluation of three automatic brain vessel segmentation methods for stereotactical trajectory planning.;BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Stereotactical procedures require exact trajectory planning to avoid blood vessels in the trajectory path. Innovation in imaging and image recognition techniques have facilitated the automatic detection of blood vessels during the planning process and may improve patient safety in the future. To assess the feasibility of a vessel detection and warning system using currently available imaging and vessel segmentation techniques. METHODS: Image data were acquired from post-contrast, isovolumetric T1-weighted sequences (T1CE) and time.-of-flight MR angiography at 3T or 7T from a total of nine subjects. Vessel segmentation by a combination of a vessel-enhancement filter with subsequent level-set segmentation was evaluated using three different methods (Vesselness, FastMarching and LevelSet) in 45 stereotactic trajectories. Segmentation results were compared to a gold-standard of manual segmentation performed jointly by two human experts. RESULTS: The LevelSet method performed best with a mean interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.76 [0.73, 0.81] compared to the FastMarching method with ICC 0.70 [0.67, 0.73] respectively. The Vesselness algorithm achieved clearly inferior overall performance with a mean ICC of 0.56 [0.53, 0.59]. The differences in mean ICC between all segmentation methods were statistically significant (p < 0.001 with post-hoc p < 0.026). The LevelSet method performed likewise good in MPRAGE and 3T-TOF images and excellent in 7T-TOF image data. The negative predictive value (NPV) was very high (>97%) for all methods and modalities. Positive predictive values (PPV) were found in the overall range of 65-90% likewise depending on algorithm and modality. This pattern reflects the disposition of all segmentation methods - in case of misclassification - to produce preferentially false-positive than false-negative results. In a clinical setting, two to three potential collision warnings would be given per trajectory on average with a PPV of around 50%. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to integrate a clinically meaningful vessel detection and collision warning system into stereotactical planning software. Both, T1CE and MRA sequences are suitable as image data for such an application.;0
Impact of Tumour Hypoxia on Evofosfamide Sensitivity in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patient-Derived Xenograft Models.;Tumour hypoxia is a marker of poor prognosis and failure of chemoradiotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), providing a strategy for therapeutic intervention in this setting. To evaluate the utility of the hypoxia-activated prodrug evofosfamide (TH-302) in HNSCC, we established ten early passage patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of HNSCC that were characterised by their histopathology, hypoxia status, gene expression, and sensitivity to evofosfamide. All PDX models closely resembled the histology of the patient tumours they were derived from. Pimonidazole-positive tumour hypoxic fractions ranged from 1.7-7.9% in line with reported HNSCC clinical values, while mRNA expression of the Toustrup hypoxia gene signature showed close correlations between PDX and matched patient tumours, together suggesting the PDX models may accurately model clinical tumour hypoxia. Evofosfamide as a single agent (50 mg/kg IP, qd x 5 for three weeks) demonstrated antitumour efficacy that was variable across the PDX models, ranging from complete regressions in one p16-positive PDX model to lack of significant activity in the three most resistant models. Despite all PDX models showing evidence of tumour hypoxia, and hypoxia being essential for activation of evofosfamide, the antitumour activity of evofosfamide only weakly correlated with tumour hypoxia status determined by pimonidazole immunohistochemistry. Other candidate evofosfamide sensitivity genes-MKI67, POR, and SLFN11-did not strongly influence evofosfamide sensitivity in univariate analyses, although a weak significant relationship with MKI67 was observed, while SLFN11 expression was lost in PDX tumours. Overall, these data confirm that evofosfamide has antitumour activity in clinically-relevant PDX tumour models of HNSCC and support further clinical evaluation of this drug in HNSCC patients. Further research is required to identify those factors that, alongside hypoxia, can influence sensitivity to evofosfamide and could act as predictive biomarkers to support its use in precision medicine therapy of HNSCC.;0
Decision Support Systems in Prostate Cancer Treatment: An Overview.;"BACKGROUND: A multifactorial decision support system (mDSS) is a tool designed to improve the clinical decision-making process, while using clinical inputs for an individual patient to generate case-specific advice. The study provides an overview of the literature to analyze current available mDSS focused on prostate cancer (PCa), in order to better understand the availability of decision support tools as well as where the current literature is lacking. METHODS: We performed a MEDLINE literature search in July 2018. We divided the included studies into different sections: diagnostic, which aids in detection or staging of PCa; treatment, supporting the decision between treatment modalities; and patient, which focusses on informing the patient. We manually screened and excluded studies that did not contain an mDSS concerning prostate cancer and study proposals. RESULTS: Our search resulted in twelve diagnostic mDSS; six treatment mDSS; two patient mDSS; and eight papers that could improve mDSS. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis mDSS is well represented in the literature as well as treatment mDSS considering external-beam radiotherapy; however, there is a lack of mDSS for other treatment modalities. The development of patient decision aids is a new field of research, and few successes have been made for PCa patients. These tools can improve personalized medicine but need to overcome a number of difficulties to be successful and require more research.";0
Concordance in postsurgical radioactive iodine therapy recommendations between Watson for Oncology and clinical practice in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma.;"BACKGROUND: To the authors' knowledge, the indications for radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) are unclear; treatment decisions are based on physician judgment. The objective of the current study was to identify the degree of concordance between postsurgical RAI therapy recommended by Watson for Oncology (WFO), a clinical decision support system for oncological therapy, and that recommended by physicians for patients with DTC. METHODS: The current retrospective cohort study included 207 patients with DTC who underwent thyroidectomy between 2017 and 2018. Treatment recommendations were considered concordant if WFO rendered recommendations consistent with those of the physicians. RESULTS: Treatment recommendations were concordant for 160 patients (77%). The concordance rate significantly differed according to the American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk category (P < .001) and American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM stage (seventh edition; P = .004). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that treatment recommendations were significantly less likely to be concordant in patients with ATA intermediate-risk and stage III disease compared with those with ATA low-risk and stage I disease (odds ratio, 0.16 [P < .001] and OR, 0.35 [P = .004], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The authors believe the concordance rate between postsurgical RAI therapy recommendations rendered by WFO and those rendered by physicians was too low to justify adopting WFO for the comprehensive screening of patients with DTC. This is particularly true among patients with ATA intermediate-risk and stage III disease, reflecting differences in practice patterns between the United States (where WFO was calibrated) and Korea. Hence, WFO is not a substitute for physicians, and also may require regional customization to improve its assistive capability.";0
Global childhood cancer survival estimates and priority-setting: a simulation-based analysis.;BACKGROUND: Accurate childhood cancer survival estimates are crucial for policy makers and clinicians for priority-setting and planning decisions. However, observed survival estimates are lacking for many countries, and when available, wide variation in outcomes is reported. Understanding the barriers to optimising survival can help improve childhood cancer outcomes. We aimed to provide estimates of global childhood cancer survival, accounting for the impact of multiple factors that affect cancer outcomes in children. METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model to simulate childhood cancer survival for 200 countries and territories worldwide, accounting for clinical and epidemiologic factors, including country-specific treatment variables, such as availability of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. To ensure model results were consistent with reported survival data, we calibrated the model to estimates from the CONCORD-2 and CONCORD-3 studies using an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach. We estimated 5-year net survival for diagnosed cases of childhood cancer in each country and territory and estimated potential survival gains of seven policy interventions focused on improving treatment availability and delivery (ie, increasing the availability of chemotherapy, radiation, general surgery, neurosurgery, or ophthalmic surgery, reducing treatment abandonment, and improving the quality of care to the mean of high-income countries) implemented in isolation or as packages. FINDINGS: Our model estimated that, for diagnosed cases, global 5-year net childhood cancer survival is currently 37.4% (95% uncertainty interval 34.7-39.8), with large variation by region, ranging from 8.1% (4.4-13.7) in eastern Africa to 83.0% (81.6-84.4) in North America. Among the seven policy interventions modelled, each individually provided small gains, increasing global 5-year net survival to between 38.4% (35.8-40.9) and 44.6% (41.7-47.4). 5-year net survival increased more substantially when policy interventions were bundled into packages that improved service delivery (5-year net survival 50.2% [47.3-53.0]) or that expanded treatment access (54.1% [50.1-58.5]). A comprehensive systems approach consisting of all policy interventions yielded superadditive gains with a global 5-year net survival of 53.6% (51.5-55.6) at 50% scale-up and 80.8% (79.5-82.1) at full implementation. INTERPRETATION: Childhood cancer survival varies widely by region, with especially poor survival in Africa. Although expanding access to treatment (chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery) and addressing financial toxicity are essential, investments that improve the quality of care, at both the health-system and facility level, are needed to improve childhood cancer outcomes globally.

Radiosurgical, neurosurgical, or no intervention for cerebral cavernous malformations: A decision analysis.;"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to evaluate the preferred treatment strategy for patients with symptomatic cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM). METHODS: In a decision model, we compared neurosurgical, radiosurgical, and conservative management. A literature review yielded the risks and outcomes of interventions, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and seizures. Patients with CCM rated their quality of life to determine utilities. We estimated the expected number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the ICH recurrence risk over five years, according to mode of presentation and CCM location (brainstem vs. other). We performed analyses with a time horizon of five years. RESULTS: Using the best available data, the expected number of QALYs for brainstem CCM presenting with ICH or focal neurological deficit was 2.84 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.54-3.08) for conservative, 3.01 (95% CI: 2.86-3.16) for neurosurgical, and 3.03 (95% CI: 2.88-3.18) for radiosurgical intervention; those for non-brainstem CCM presenting with ICH or focal neurological deficit were 3.08 (95% CI: 2.85-3.31) for conservative, 3.21 (95% CI: 3.01-3.36) for neurosurgical, and 3.19 (95% CI: 2.98-3.37) for radiosurgical intervention. For CCM presenting with epilepsy, QALYs were 3.09 (95% CI: 3.03-3.16) for conservative, 3.33 (95% CI: 3.31-3.34) for neurosurgical, and 3.27 (95% CI: 3.24-3.30) for radiosurgical intervention. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: For the initial five years after presentation, our study provides Class III evidence that for CCM presenting with ICH or focal neurological deficit conservative management is the first option, and for CCM presenting with epilepsy CCM intervention should be considered. More comparative studies with long-term follow-up are needed.";0
Understanding patients' values and preferences regarding early stage lung cancer treatment decision making.;"INTRODUCTION: With advances in treatments among patients with lung cancer, it is increasingly important to understand patients' values and preferences to facilitate shared decision making. METHODS: Prospective, multicenter study of patients with treated stage I lung cancer. At the time of study participation, participants were 4-6 months posttreatment. Value clarification and discrete choice methods were used to elicit participants' values and treatment preferences regarding stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and surgical resection using only treatment attributes. RESULTS: Among 114 participants, mean age was 70 years (Standard Deviation = 7.9), 65% were male, 68 (60%) received SBRT and 46 (40%) received surgery. More participants valued independence and quality of life (QOL) as ""most important"" compared to survival or cancer recurrence. Most participants (83%) were willing to accept lung cancer treatment with a 2% chance of periprocedural death for only one additional year of life. Participants also valued independence more than additional years of life as most (86%) were unwilling to accept either permanent placement in a nursing home or being limited to a bed/chair for four additional years of life. Surprisingly, treatment discordance was common as 49% of participants preferred the alternative lung cancer treatment than what they received. CONCLUSIONS: Among participants with early stage lung cancer, maintaining independence and QOL were more highly valued than survival or cancer recurrence. Participants were willing to accept high periprocedural mortality, but not severe deficits affecting QOL when considering treatment. Treatment discordance was common among participants who received SBRT or surgery. Understanding patients' values and preferences regarding treatment decisions is essential to foster shared decision making and ensure treatment plans are consistent with patients' goals. Clinicians need more resources to engage in high quality communication during lung cancer treatment discussions.";0
Intent of health care providers to adopt a clinical decision support tool in the management of minor pediatric head injuries.;BACKGROUND: Radiographic neuroimaging in minor pediatric head injuries contains risks of radiation-induced malignancy. The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) head injury protocol identifies head-injured children who are at very low risk of clinically important traumatic brain injuries and can safely not receive a head computed tomography (CT) scan. LOCAL PROBLEM: The identified urgent care facility had no facility-wide protocol to manage head injuries. METHODS: The purpose of the evidence-based practice project was to educate health care providers on the risks of indiscriminate head CT prescription and the utility of the PECARN head injury protocol in the management of minor pediatric head injuries. INTERVENTIONS: A knowledge assessment was conducted using pre- and posttests and the likelihood to adopt the PECARN head injury protocol in clinical practice was evaluated using the Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale. Additionally, rates of head CT scans ordered that were inappropriate according to the PECARN head injury protocol were calculated postproject and compared with preproject rates. RESULTS: Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. Findings included increase in provider knowledge on the use of the PECARN head injury protocol and high likelihood of intent to adopt the PECARN head injury protocol in clinical practice. In addition, rates of head CT prescription postproject were lower than preproject rates, and 82.61% of CT scans ordered postproject were appropriate according to the PECARN head injury protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Using the PECARN head injury protocol was associated with consistency of care, reduced unnecessary health care resource utilization, and health care costs.;0
Surgical Resection Margin Classifications for High-grade Pleomorphic Soft Tissue Sarcomas of the Extremity or Trunk After Neoadjuvant Cytotoxic Therapy.;Soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities or trunk are often resected after treatment with neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Adequate surgical resection margins for sarcomas after neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy are not well characterized. Minimum surgical resection margins required for local control of primary, high-grade, pleomorphic soft tissue sarcomas treated with neoadjuvant therapy was assessed by competing risk regression in a series of 166 cases. Optimal tumor clearance was determined to be >/=1 mm. Predictive accuracy of three commonly used resection margin classification schemes (American Joint Committee on Cancer, Musculoskeletal Tumor Society, and the margin distance method) were comparable. However, diagnostic performance of a binary system (positive vs. negative) was more specific than margin distance classification (positive or <1 vs. >/=1 mm from tumor), but less sensitive in predicting local recurrence. The American Joint Committee on Cancer R classification (R0 vs. R1/R2) seems to adequately stratify patients by risk for local recurrence after neoadjuvant therapy and subsequent surgical resection. Furthermore, close but negative resection margins (<1 mm from tumor) appear sufficient for local control of high-grade pleomorphic soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity or trunk in this clinical setting, with minimal reduction in the risk of local recurrence with increasing margin width or surgical clearance.;0
Safety and efficacy of oncolytic HSV-1 G207 inoculated into the cerebellum of mice.;Primary malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the leading cause of childhood cancer-related death and morbidity. While advances in surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy have improved the survival rates in children with malignant brain tumors, mortality persists in certain subpopulations and current therapies are associated with extreme morbidity. This is especially true for children with malignant infratentorial tumors. Accordingly, G207, a genetically engineered herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) capable of selectively targeting cancer cells has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for this patient population. Herein, we demonstrate that cerebellar inoculation of G207 was systemically non-toxic in an immunocompetent, HSV-1 sensitive mouse strain (CBA/J). Mice had neither abnormal brain/organ pathology nor evidence of G207 replication by immunohistochemistry at days 7 and 30 after cerebellar G207 inoculation. While a minute amount viral DNA was recovered in the cerebellum and brainstem of mice at day 7, no viral DNA persisted at day 30. Critically, G207 delivered to the cerebellum was able to target/treat the highly aggressive MYC-overexpressed group 3 murine medulloblastoma increasing survival vs controls. These results provide critical safety and efficacy data to support the translation of G207 for pediatric clinical trials in intractable cerebellar malignancies.;0
A Markov decision process approach to optimizing cancer therapy using multiple modalities.;"There are several different modalities, e.g. surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, that are currently used to treat cancer. It is common practice to use a combination of these modalities to maximize clinical outcomes, which are often measured by a balance between maximizing tumor damage and minimizing normal tissue side effects due to treatment. However, multi-modality treatment policies are mostly empirical in current practice and are therefore subject to individual clinicians' experiences and intuition. We present a novel formulation of optimal multi-modality cancer management using a finite-horizon Markov decision process approach. Specifically, at each decision epoch, the clinician chooses an optimal treatment modality based on the patient's observed state, which we define as a combination of tumor progression and normal tissue side effect. Treatment modalities are categorized as (1) type 1, which has a high risk and high reward, but is restricted in the frequency of administration during a treatment course; (2) type 2, which has a lower risk and lower reward than type 1, but may be repeated without restriction; and (3) type 3, no treatment (surveillance), which has the possibility of reducing normal tissue side effect at the risk of worsening tumor progression. Numerical simulations using various intuitive, concave reward functions show the structural insights of optimal policies and demonstrate the potential applications of using a rigorous approach to optimizing multi-modality cancer management.";0
Utility of a Clinical Decision Support System in Weight Loss Prediction After Head and Neck Cancer Radiotherapy.;"PURPOSE: To evaluate the utility of a clinical decision support system (CDSS) using a weight loss prediction model. METHODS: A prediction model for significant weight loss (loss of greater than or equal to 7.5% of body mass at 3-month post radiotherapy) was created with clinical, dosimetric, and radiomics predictors from 63 patients in an independent training data set (accuracy, 0.78; area under the curve [AUC], 0.81) using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression. Four physicians with varying experience levels were then recruited to evaluate 100 patients in an independent validation data set of head and neck cancer twice (ie, a pre-post design): first without and then with the aid of a CDSS derived from the prediction model. At both evaluations, physicians were asked to predict the development (yes/no) and probability of significant weight loss for each patient on the basis of patient characteristics, including pretreatment dysphagia and weight loss and information from the treatment plan. At the second evaluation, physicians were also provided with the prediction model's results for weight loss probability. Physicians' predictions were compared with actual weight loss, and accuracy and AUC were investigated between the two evaluations. RESULTS: The mean accuracy of the physicians' ability to identify patients who will experience significant weight loss (yes/no) increased from 0.58 (range, 0.47 to 0.63) to 0.63 (range, 0.58 to 0.72) with the CDSS ( P = .06). The AUC of weight loss probability predicted by physicians significantly increased from 0.56 (range, 0.46 to 0.64) to 0.69 (range, 0.63 to 0.73) with the aid of the CDSS ( P < .05). Specifically, more improvement was observed among less-experienced physicians ( P < .01). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results demonstrate that physicians' decisions may be improved by a weight loss CDSS model, especially among less-experienced physicians. Additional study with a larger cohort of patients and more participating physicians is thus warranted for understanding the usefulness of CDSSs.";0
Concordance Rate between Clinicians and Watson for Oncology among Patients with Advanced Gastric Cancer: Early, Real-World Experience in Korea.;"BACKGROUNDS/AIMS: Watson for Oncology (WFO) is a cognitive technology that processes medical information by analyzing the latest evidence and guidelines. However, studies of the concordance rate between WFO and clinicians for advanced gastric cancer (AGC) are lacking. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 65 patients with AGC who consulted WFO and the Gachon Gil Medical Center multidisciplinary team (GMDT) in 2016 and 2017. The recommendations of WFO were compared with the opinions of the GMDT. WFO provided three treatment options: recommended (first treatment option), for consideration (second treatment option), and not recommended. RESULTS: In total, 65 patients (mean age 61.0 years; 44 males and 21 females) were included in the study. The concordance rate between WFO and the GMDT was 41.5% (27/65) at the recommended level and 87.7% (57/65) at the for consideration level. The main causes of discordance between WFO and the GMDT were as follows. First, WFO did not consider the medical history. Second, WFO recommended the use of agents that are considered outdated in Korea. Third, some patients wanted to be involved in a clinical trial. Fourth, some patients refused to use the biologic agents recommended by WFO for financial reasons as they were not covered by medical insurance. CONCLUSIONS: The concordance rate at the recommended level was relatively low but was higher at the for consideration level. Discordances arose mainly from the different medical circumstances at the Gachon Gil Medical Center (GMC) and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), the main WFO consulting center. The utility of WFO as a tool for supporting clinical decision making could be further improved by incorporating regional guidelines.";0
Segmenting lung tumors on longitudinal imaging studies via a patient-specific adaptive convolutional neural network.;Purpose: To design a deep learning algorithm that automatically delineates lung tumors seen on weekly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans acquired during radiotherapy and facilitates the analysis of geometric tumor changes. Methods: This longitudinal imaging study comprised 9 lung cancer patients who had 6-7 weekly T2-weighted MRI scans during radiotherapy. Tumors on all scans were manually contoured as the ground truth. Meanwhile, a patient-specific adaptive convolutional neural network (A-net) was developed to simulate the workflow of adaptive radiotherapy and to utilize past weekly MRI and tumor contours to segment tumors on the current weekly MRI. To augment the training data, each voxel inside the volume of interest was expanded to a 3  3 cm patch as the input, whereas the classification of the corresponding patch, background or tumor, was the output. Training was updated weekly to incorporate the latest MRI scan. For comparison, a population-based neural network was implemented, trained, and validated on the leave-one-out scheme. Both algorithms were evaluated by their precision, DICE coefficient, and root mean square surface distance between the manual and computerized segmentations. Results: Training of A-net converged well within 2 h of computations on a computer cluster. A-net segmented the weekly MR with a precision, DICE, and root mean square surface distance of 0.81  0.10, 0.82  0.10, and 2.4  1.4 mm, and outperformed the population-based algorithm with 0.63  0.21, 0.64  0.19, and 4.1  3.0 mm, respectively. Conclusion: A-net can be feasibly integrated into the clinical workflow of a longitudinal imaging study and become a valuable tool to facilitate decision- making in adaptive radiotherapy.;0
Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: Executive Summary of an ASTRO, ASCO and AUA Evidence-Based Guideline.;PURPOSE: The aim of this guideline is to present recommendations regarding moderately hypofractionated (240-340 cGy per fraction) and ultrahypofractionated (500 cGy or more per fraction) radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The American Society for Radiation Oncology convened a task force to address 8 key questions on appropriate indications and dose-fractionation for moderately and ultrahypofractionated radiation therapy, as well as technical issues, including normal tissue dose constraints, treatment volumes, and use of image guided and intensity modulated radiation therapy. Recommendations were based on a systematic literature review and created using a predefined consensus-building methodology and Society-approved tools for grading evidence quality and recommendation strength. RESULTS: Based on high-quality evidence, strong consensus was reached for offering moderate hypofractionation across risk groups to patients choosing external beam radiation therapy. The task force conditionally recommends ultrahypofractionated radiation may be offered for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer but strongly encourages treatment of intermediate-risk patients on a clinical trial or multi-institutional registry. For high-risk patients, the task force conditionally recommends against routine use of ultrahypofractionated external beam radiation therapy. With any hypofractionated approach, the task force strongly recommends image guided radiation therapy and avoidance of nonmodulated 3-dimensional conformal techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated radiation therapy provides important potential advantages in cost and convenience for patients, and these recommendations are intended to provide guidance on moderate hypofractionation and ultrahypofractionation for localized prostate cancer. The limits in the current evidentiary base-especially for ultrahypofractionation-highlight the imperative to support large-scale randomized clinical trials and underscore the importance of shared decision making between clinicians and patients.;0
Decision Support Systems in Oncology.;Precision medicine is the future of health care: please watch the animation at https://vimeo.com/241154708 . As a technology-intensive and -dependent medical discipline, oncology will be at the vanguard of this impending change. However, to bring about precision medicine, a fundamental conundrum must be solved: Human cognitive capacity, typically constrained to five variables for decision making in the context of the increasing number of available biomarkers and therapeutic options, is a limiting factor to the realization of precision medicine. Given this level of complexity and the restriction of human decision making, current methods are untenable. A solution to this challenge is multifactorial decision support systems (DSSs), continuously learning artificial intelligence platforms that integrate all available data-clinical, imaging, biologic, genetic, cost-to produce validated predictive models. DSSs compare the personalized probable outcomes-toxicity, tumor control, quality of life, cost effectiveness-of various care pathway decisions to ensure optimal efficacy and economy. DSSs can be integrated into the workflows both strategically (at the multidisciplinary tumor board level to support treatment choice, eg, surgery or radiotherapy) and tactically (at the specialist level to support treatment technique, eg, prostate spacer or not). In some countries, the reimbursement of certain treatments, such as proton therapy, is already conditional on the basis that a DSS is used. DSSs have many stakeholders-clinicians, medical directors, medical insurers, patient advocacy groups-and are a natural consequence of big data in health care. Here, we provide an overview of DSSs, their challenges, opportunities, and capacity to improve clinical decision making, with an emphasis on the utility in oncology.;0
NCTN Assessment on Current Applications of Radiomics in Oncology.;Radiomics is a fast-growing research area based on converting standard-of-care imaging into quantitative minable data and building subsequent predictive models to personalize treatment. Radiomics has been proposed as a study objective in clinical trial concepts and a potential biomarker for stratifying patients across interventional treatment arms. In recognizing the growing importance of radiomics in oncology, a group of medical physicists and clinicians from NRG Oncology reviewed the current status of the field and identified critical issues, providing a general assessment and early recommendations for incorporation in oncology studies.;0
Studying the regression profiles of cervical tumours during radiotherapy treatment using a patient-specific multiscale model.;Apart from offering insight into the biomechanisms involved in cancer, many recent mathematical modeling efforts aspire to the ultimate goal of clinical translation, wherein models are designed to be used in the future as clinical decision support systems in the patient-individualized context. Most significant challenges are the integration of multiscale biodata and the patient-specific model parameterization. A central aim of this study was the design of a clinically-relevant parameterization methodology for a patient-specific computational model of cervical cancer response to radiotherapy treatment with concomitant cisplatin, built around a tumour features-based search of the parameter space. Additionally, a methodological framework for the predictive use of the model was designed, including a scoring method to quantitatively reflect the similarity and bilateral predictive ability of any two tumours in terms of their regression profile. The methodology was applied to the datasets of eight patients. Tumour scenarios in accordance with the available longitudinal data have been determined. Predictive investigations identified three patient cases, anyone of which can be used to predict the volumetric evolution throughout therapy of the tumours of the other two with very good results. Our observations show that the presented approach is promising in quantifiably differentiating tumours with distinct regression profiles.;0
Fertility preservation in adolescent and young adult cancer patients: From a part of a national survey on oncofertility in Japan.;PURPOSE: This study evaluated the current status of reproductive disorders and provision of information on oncofertility to female adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients in Japan. METHODS: A national survey of AYA cancer survivors was conducted. Children were <15 years old, and AYAs were 15-39 years old. Results from the survivors of other than gynecological disease who underwent chemotherapy were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the survivors, 41.4% were concerned about their reproductive function and infertility, and 36.2% were aware of menstrual cycle abnormalities. Among them, 15.5% (n = 20) of all and 21.2% (n = 17) of the AYA-onset survivors suffered infertility due to chemo- or radiotherapy and gave up childbearing. These rates were significantly higher than those of healthy AYAs. Although 80.8% of AYA-onset survivors answered that they had received information on reproductive function and infertility, only 55.8% had received information on fertility preservation methods. Furthermore, only 22.4% of all and 42.3% of AYA-onset survivors had received pretreatment information on fertility preservation methods. CONCLUSIONS: Not a few AYA cancer survivors reported reproductive dysfunction. These findings indicate that information provided on therapy-related problems before cancer treatment in Japan was insufficient and highlight the need to improve patient decision-making and support systems for fertility preservation.;0
Advances in multidisciplinary therapy for meningiomas.;Surgery has long been established as the first-line treatment for the majority of symptomatic and enlarging meningiomas, and evidence for its success is derived from retrospective case series. Despite surgical resection, a subset of meningiomas display aggressive behavior with early recurrences that are difficult to treat. The decision to radically resect meningiomas and involved structures is balanced against the risk for neurological injury in patients. Radiation therapy has largely been used as a complementary and safe therapeutic strategy in meningiomas with evidence primarily stemming from retrospective, single-institution reports. Two of the first cooperative group studies (RTOG 0539 and EORTC 22042) evaluating the outcomes of adjuvant radiation therapy in higher-risk meningiomas have shown promising preliminary results. Historically, systemic therapy has resulted in disappointing results in meningiomas. However, several clinical trials are under way evaluating the efficacy of chemotherapies, such as trabectedin, and novel molecular agents targeting Smoothened, AKT1, and focal adhesion kinase in patients with recurrent meningiomas.;0
Association of Long-term Outcomes and Survival With Multidisciplinary Salvage Treatment for Local and Regional Recurrence After Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for Early-Stage Lung Cancer.;"IMPORTANCE: Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is first-line treatment for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who cannot undergo surgery. However, up to 1 in 6 such patients will develop isolated local recurrence (iLR) or isolated regional recurrence (iRR). Little is known about outcomes when disease recurs after SABR, or about optimal management strategies for such recurrences. OBJECTIVE: To characterize long-term outcomes for patients with iLR or iRR after SABR for early-stage NSCLC with the aim of informing treatment decision making for these patients with potentially curable disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, a retrospective review was conducted of 912 patients prospectively enrolled in an institutional database at a tertiary cancer center from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival, progression-free survival, recurrence patterns, demographics, salvage techniques, patterns of salvage failure, and toxic effects. RESULTS: Of the 912 patients in the study (456 women and 456 men; median age, 72 years [range, 46-91 years]), 756 (82.9%) had T1 tumors at initial diagnosis; 502 tumors (55.0%) were adenocarcinomas and 309 tumors (33.9%) were squamous cell carcinomas. Of 912 patients with early-stage I to II NSCLC who received definitive SABR (50 Gy in 4 fractions or 70 Gy in 10 fractions), 102 developed isolated recurrence (49 with iLR and 53 with iRR), and 658 had no recurrence. Median times to recurrence after SABR were 14.5 months (range, 1.5-60.8 months) for iLR and 9.0 months (range, 1.9-70.7 months) for iRR; 39 of 49 patients (79.6%) with iLR and 48 of 53 patients (90.6%) with iRR underwent salvage with reirradiation, surgery, thermal ablation, or chemotherapy. Median follow-up times for patients with iLR or iRR were 57.2 months (interquartile range, 37.7-87.6 months) from initial SABR and 38.5 months (interquartile range, 19.9-69.3 months) from recurrence. Rates of overall survival at 5 years from initial SABR were no different between patients with iLR and salvage treatment (57.9%) and patients with no recurrence (54.9%; hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.56-1.43; P = .65) but were lower for patients with iRR and salvage treatment (31.1%; hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.00-2.34; P = .049). Patients receiving salvage treatment had longer overall survival than patients who did not (median, 37 vs 7 months after recurrence; hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.09-0.66; P = .006). Twenty-four of 87 patients (27.6%) who received salvage treatment for iLR or iRR subsequently developed distant metastases. No patient experienced grade 5 toxic effects after salvage treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Life expectancy after salvage treatment for iLR was similar to that for patients without recurrence, but survival after salvage treatment for iRR was similar to that of patients with stage III NSCLC. Patients who received salvage treatment had significantly improved survival. Because salvage treatment for iLR or iRR was based on a consistent multidisciplinary approach, this may help in clinical decision making.";0
Sexual Health Problems and Discussion in Colorectal Cancer Patients Two Years After Diagnosis: A National Cross-Sectional Study.;"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is accompanied by specific treatment-related physical (ostomy, incontinence) and psychosexual (body image, depression) consequences on sexual health. AIM: To assess sexual health of patients with CRC 2 years after diagnosis. METHODS: We selected all patients with CRC from a French nationwide longitudinal study. Data sources included patient questionnaires, medical questionnaires, and medico-administrative databases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We evaluated sexual health using the Relationship and Sexuality Scale and assessed self-reported rates of discussion about sexuality with health care providers. RESULTS: Across the 487 patients, 258 were men and 229 were women; 77% were diagnosed with colon cancer and 23% with rectal cancer. Overall, 54% of patients reported a decrease in sexual desire, 61% a decrease in frequency of intercourse, and 48% a decrease in the possibility to reach an orgasm. Patients still experiencing fecal incontinence 2 years after diagnosis had decreases in all sexual desire, intercourse, orgasm, and satisfaction Relationship and Sexuality Scale items. Patients with rectal cancer had significantly more frequent troubles with desire and orgasm than did patients with colon cancer (P = .003 and P = .014, respectively). Regarding the discussion about sexuality, only 20% of men, 11% of women, 11% of patients with colon cancer, and 33% of patients with rectal cancer recalled having discussed sexuality with the medical team. Factors independently increasing the chance to have discussed sexuality with the medical team were younger age (odds ratio [OR] = 2.77 [1.31; 5.84]; P = .007), having an ostomy (OR = 2.93 [1.27; 6.73]; P = .011), and radiotherapy (OR = 2.78 [1.23; 6.27]; P = .014). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: These results highlight the need for developing interventions to improve information delivery at cancer announcement and for managing sexual troubles during survivorship in patients with CRC, particularly those experiencing fecal incontinence. STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: Strengths are the sample size and the national representation using the data of a large-scale nation-wide survey, with the possibility of comparing colon and rectal cancers. Limitations are the assessment of sexuality 2 years after diagnosis and using only self-reported measures. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the lack of discussion about sexuality with the oncology team and the need for specific sexual rehabilitation interventions, especially for patients with rectal cancer and fecal incontinence. Developing these aspects may help patients with CRC improve their sexual prognosis. Almont T, Bouhnik A-D, Charif AB, et al.

Log file-based dose reconstruction and accumulation for 4D adaptive pencil beam scanned proton therapy in a clinical treatment planning system: Implementation and proof-of-concept.;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Motion-induced uncertainties hamper the clinical implementation of pencil beam scanning proton therapy (PBS-PT). Prospective pretreatment evaluations only provide multiscenario predictions without giving a clear conclusion for the actual treatment. Therefore, in this proof-of-concept study we present a methodology for a fraction-wise retrospective four-dimensional (4D) dose reconstruction and accumulation aiming at the evaluation of treatment quality during and after treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We implemented an easy-to-use, script-based 4D dose assessment of PBS-PT for patients with moving tumors in a commercially available treatment planning system. This 4D dose accumulation uses treatment delivery log files and breathing pattern records of each fraction as well as weekly repeated 4D-CT scans acquired during the treatment course. The approach was validated experimentally and was executed for an exemplary dataset of a lung cancer patient. RESULTS: The script-based 4D dose reconstruction and accumulation was implemented successfully, requiring minimal user input and a reasonable processing time (around 10 min for a fraction dose assessment). An experimental validation using a dynamic CIRS thorax phantom confirmed the precision of the 4D dose reconstruction methodology. In a proof-of-concept study, the accumulation of 33 reconstructed fraction doses showed a linear increase of D98 values. Projected treatment course D98 values revealed a CTV underdosage after fraction 25. This loss of target coverage was confirmed in a dose volume histogram comparison of the nominal, the projected (after 16 fractions) and the accumulated (after 33 fractions) dose distribution. CONCLUSIONS: The presented method allows for the assessment of the conformity between planned and delivered dose as the treatment course progresses. The implemented approach considers the influence of changing patient anatomy and variations in the breathing pattern. This facilitates treatment quality evaluation and supports decisions regarding plan adaptation. In a next step, this approach will be applied to a larger patient cohort to investigate its capability as 4D quality control and decision support tool for treatment adaptation.;0
Cost-effectiveness and Budgetary Consequence Analysis of Durvalumab Consolidation Therapy vs No Consolidation Therapy After Chemoradiotherapy in Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Context of the US Health Care System.;IMPORTANCE: In early 2018, durvalumab became the first immunotherapy to be approved for adjuvant treatment of patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose cancer has not progressed after definitive chemoradiotherapy. However, the cost-effectiveness and potential economic implications of using this high-priced therapy in this indication are unknown to date. OBJECTIVE: To explore the cost-effectiveness and potential budgetary consequences of durvalumab consolidation therapy vs no consolidation therapy after chemoradiotherapy in stage III NSCLC in the context of the US health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A decision analytic microsimulation model was developed in an academic medical setting to compare the following 2 postchemoradiotherapy strategies: all patients receive no consolidation therapy until progression vs all patients receive durvalumab consolidation therapy until progression or for a maximum of 1 year. The potential budgetary consequence was calculated by applying the proportion of patients with NSCLC who were diagnosed in stage III and received chemoradiotherapy to the projected number of annual new cases for 2018 to 2022 to find total eligible patients and then multiplied by the mean difference in annual cost between the strategies over this 5-year period. Simulated conditions were matched to those of the PACIFIC phase 3 randomized clinical trial and reasonable treatment strategies for metastatic NSCLC. All simulated patients begin disease free after having received radical treatment with chemoradiotherapy and are followed up as they progress to metastatic disease first-line treatment, metastatic disease second-line treatment, end-stage progressive disease, and death. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome of this study was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of durvalumab consolidation therapy vs no consolidation therapy, given as aggregate cost of treatment per quality-adjusted life-year gained. RESULTS: Among 2 million simulated patients, durvalumab consolidation therapy was cost-effective compared with no consolidation therapy at a $100000 per quality-adjusted life-year willingness-to-pay threshold, with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $67421 per quality-adjusted life-year, and would contribute an additional $768 million to national cancer spending in year 1. The annual budgetary consequence would then decrease to $241 million in year 5. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Durvalumab consolidation therapy represents an indication where expensive immunotherapies can be cost-effective. Treating with immunotherapy earlier in the course of cancer progression can provide significant value, despite having a substantial budgetary consequence.;0
Evaluation of the reconstructed dose from the three-dimensional dose module of a helical diode array: factors of influence and error detection.;The 3D-dose module (3DVH) of the ArcCHECK-phantom reconstructs the dose distribution in the phantom volume and transfers it to the patient geometry. Our aim was to evaluate the 3DVH-reconstructed dose systematically building up from simple to complex cases. Therefore, the influence of different field sizes without and with blocking the isocenter was tested. The dose distributions of different radiation techniques, error-free and error-induced VMAT-plans were verified by measuring with films and other detectors in the phantom. It was checked how the inclusion of the dose measured separately in the ArcCHECK-isocenter affects the reconstruction. Thus it was also investigated which detector should be used for the dosimetry in the isocenter. Without including the isocentrically measured dose, the reconstruction for the smallest field (2  x  2 cm(2)) was 5% (6 MV) and 3.7% (10 MV) higher than measured with an ionization chamber. With increasing field size, the deviation decreased. For fields with blocked isocenters, the reconstructed dose was between  -10.6% and  -24% lower than determined with a microDiamond. Measurements with the Semiflex of the spinal plan resulted in higher doses than calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS) and measured with the film and the other detectors. Through the inclusion of the isocentric dose in the reconstruction its accordance with the film increased mostly. With exception of an error-induced head and neck plan, the induced errors in the reconstructed dose volume histogram became visible, but were underestimated. With the 3DVH-algorithm not every induced-error was detected. The 3DVH underestimated the dose in blocked areas. To protect organs at risk (OAR), these are often blocked. Consequently, there is a risk that a clinical decision is based on a 3DVH that underestimated the dose for the OAR. We recommend including the isocentric dose in the reconstruction. The detector used for the isocentric measurements should be carefully chosen.;0
Current evidence for spinal X-ray use in the chiropractic profession: a narrative review.;The use of routine spinal X-rays within chiropractic has a contentious history. Elements of the profession advocate for the need for routine spinal X-rays to improve patient management, whereas other chiropractors advocate using spinal X-rays only when endorsed by current imaging guidelines. This review aims to summarise the current evidence for the use of spinal X-ray in chiropractic practice, with consideration of the related risks and benefits. Current evidence supports the use of spinal X-rays only in the diagnosis of trauma and spondyloarthropathy, and in the assessment of progressive spinal structural deformities such as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. MRI is indicated to diagnose serious pathology such as cancer or infection, and to assess the need for surgical management in radiculopathy and spinal stenosis. Strong evidence demonstrates risks of imaging such as excessive radiation exposure, overdiagnosis, subsequent low-value investigation and treatment procedures, and increased costs. In most cases the potential benefits from routine imaging, including spinal X-rays, do not outweigh the potential harms. The use of spinal X-rays should not be routinely performed in chiropractic practice, and should be guided by clinical guidelines and clinician judgement.;0
Association Between Lymph Node Ratio and Recurrence and Survival Outcomes in Patients With Oral Cavity Cancer.;"IMPORTANCE: Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) is associated with often-delayed clinical diagnosis, poor prognosis, and expensive therapeutic approaches. Prognostic accuracy is important in improving treatment outcomes of patients with this disease. OBJECTIVES: To assess lymph node ratio (LNR) and other factors in estimating response to treatment and provide prognostic information helpful for clinical decision making. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2015, at an academic hospital in Denver, Colorado. Participants included 149 patients with primary OCSCC who received curative-intent surgery and/or postoperative adjuvant therapies. Analysis was performed from December 8, 2017, to August 15, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), locoregional disease-free survival (LRDFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMDFS) adjusted for known prognostic risk factors, as well as correlation of LNR with other histopathologic prognostic factors. RESULTS: Of the 149 patients included in analysis, 105 were men (70.5%); the median age at diagnosis was 59 years (range, 28-88 years). Using the Kaplan-Meier method, the 5-year survival estimates for OS rate was 40.4% (95% CI, 31.3%-49.3%); DFS, 48.6% (95% CI, 38.6%-58.0%); LRDFS, 57.7% (95% CI, 46.6%-67.2%); and DMDFS, 74.7% (95% CI, 65.1%-82.0%). The median follow-up was 20 months for all patients and 34.5 months (range, 0-137 months) for surviving patients. Nonwhite race (hazard ratio [HR], 2.15; 95% CI, 1.22-3.81), T3-T4 category (HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.18-3.35), and LNR greater than 10% (HR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.39-5.27) were associated with poorer OS. Nonwhite patients also had higher risk of locoregional failures (HR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.28-4.79), whereas women were more likely to have distant metastasis (HR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.14-5.71). Floor-of-mouth subsite had fewer locoregional recurrences than did other subsites (HR, 0.45, 95% CI, 0.21-0.99). An LNR greater than 10% independently was associated with worse OS (HR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.39-5.27), DFS (HR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.18-5.22), and DMDFS (HR, 6.05; 95% CI, 1.54-23.71). The LNR was associated with N-stage (Cramer V, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58-0.78), extracapsular extension (Cramer V, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.44-0.66), lymphovascular invasion (Cramer V, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27-0.61); number of excised lymph nodes (Cramer V, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.06-0.37), margin (Cramer V, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.05-0.38), and tumor thickness combined with depth of invasion (Cramer V, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.05-0.38). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Locoregional treatment failure remained the predominant pattern of failure. An advanced pathologic stage and nonwhite race were found to be associated with worse outcomes. The findings from this study suggest that LNR is the most robust prognostic factor and appears to have implications for risk stratification in this disease.";0
Applying Artificial Intelligence to Address the Knowledge Gaps in Cancer Care.;"BACKGROUND: Rapid advances in science challenge the timely adoption of evidence-based care in community settings. To bridge the gap between what is possible and what is practiced, we researched approaches to developing an artificial intelligence (AI) application that can provide real-time patient-specific decision support. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Oncology Expert Advisor (OEA) was designed to simulate peer-to-peer consultation with three core functions: patient history summarization, treatment options recommendation, and management advisory. Machine-learning algorithms were trained to construct a dynamic summary of patients cancer history and to suggest approved therapy or investigative trial options. All patient data used were retrospectively accrued. Ground truth was established for approximately 1,000 unique patients. The full Medline database of more than 23 million published abstracts was used as the literature corpus. RESULTS: OEA's accuracies of searching disparate sources within electronic medical records to extract complex clinical concepts from unstructured text documents varied, with F1 scores of 90%-96% for non-time-dependent concepts (e.g., diagnosis) and F1 scores of 63%-65% for time-dependent concepts (e.g., therapy history timeline). Based on constructed patient profiles, OEA suggests approved therapy options linked to supporting evidence (99.9% recall; 88% precision), and screens for eligible clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov (97.9% recall; 96.9% precision). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated technical feasibility of an AI-powered application to construct longitudinal patient profiles in context and to suggest evidence-based treatment and trial options. Our experience highlighted the necessity of collaboration across clinical and AI domains, and the requirement of clinical expertise throughout the process, from design to training to testing. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital advisors such as the Oncology Expert Advisor have the potential to augment the capacity and update the knowledge base of practicing oncologists. By constructing dynamic patient profiles from disparate data sources and organizing and vetting vast literature for relevance to a specific patient, such AI applications could empower oncologists to consider all therapy options based on the latest scientific evidence for their patients, and help them spend less time on information ""hunting and gathering"" and more time with the patients. However, realization of this will require not only AI technology maturation but also active participation and leadership by clincial experts.";0
Radiation-induced lung toxicity in mice irradiated in a strong magnetic field.;Strong magnetic fields affect radiation dose deposition in MRI-guided radiation therapy systems, particularly at interfaces between tissues of differing densities such as those in the thorax. In this study, we evaluated the impact of a 1.5 T magnetic field on radiation-induced lung damage in C57L/J mice. We irradiated 140 mice to the whole thorax with parallel-opposed Co-60 beams to doses of 0, 9.0, 10.0, 10.5, 11.0, 12.0, or 13.0 Gy (20 mice per dose group). Ten mice per dose group were irradiated while a 1.5 T magnetic field was applied transverse to the radiation beam and ten mice were irradiated with the magnetic field set to 0 T. We compared survival and noninvasive assays of radiation-induced lung damage, namely respiratory rate and metrics derived from thoracic cone-beam CTs, between the two sets of mice. We report two main results. First, the presence of a transverse 1.5 T field during irradiation had no impact on survival of C57L/J mice. Second, there was a small but statistically significant effect on noninvasive assays of radiation-induced lung damage. These results provide critical safety data for the clinical introduction of MRI-guided radiation therapy systems.;0
Big Data in Head and Neck Cancer.;"Head and neck cancers can be used as a paradigm for exploring ""big data"" applications in oncology. Computational strategies derived from big data science hold the promise of shedding new light on the molecular mechanisms driving head and neck cancer pathogenesis, identifying new prognostic and predictive factors, and discovering potential therapeutics against this highly complex disease. Big data strategies integrate robust data input, from radiomics, genomics, and clinical-epidemiological data to deeply describe head and neck cancer characteristics. Thus, big data may advance research generating new knowledge and improve head and neck cancer prognosis supporting clinical decision-making and development of treatment recommendations.";0
Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: Executive Summary of an ASTRO, ASCO, and AUA Evidence-Based Guideline.;PURPOSE: The aim of this guideline is to present recommendations regarding moderately hypofractionated (240-340 cGy per fraction) and ultrahypofractionated (500 cGy or more per fraction) radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The American Society for Radiation Oncology convened a task force to address 8 key questions on appropriate indications and dose-fractionation for moderately and ultrahypofractionated radiation therapy, as well as technical issues, including normal tissue dose constraints, treatment volumes, and use of image guided and intensity modulated radiation therapy. Recommendations were based on a systematic literature review and created using a predefined consensus-building methodology and Society-approved tools for grading evidence quality and recommendation strength. RESULTS: Based on high-quality evidence, strong consensus was reached for offering moderate hypofractionation across risk groups to patients choosing external beam radiation therapy. The task force conditionally recommends ultrahypofractionated radiation may be offered for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer but strongly encourages treatment of intermediate-risk patients on a clinical trial or multi-institutional registry. For high-risk patients, the task force conditionally recommends against routine use of ultrahypofractionated external beam radiation therapy. With any hypofractionated approach, the task force strongly recommends image guided radiation therapy and avoidance of nonmodulated 3-dimensional conformal techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Hypofractionated radiation therapy provides important potential advantages in cost and convenience for patients, and these recommendations are intended to provide guidance on moderate hypofractionation and ultrahypofractionation for localized prostate cancer. The limits in the current evidentiary base-especially for ultrahypofractionation-highlight the imperative to support large-scale randomized clinical trials and underscore the importance of shared decision making between clinicians and patients.;0
askMUSIC: Leveraging a Clinical Registry to Develop a New Machine Learning Model to Inform Patients of Prostate Cancer Treatments Chosen by Similar Men.;BACKGROUND: Clinical registries provide physicians with a means for making data-driven decisions but few opportunities exist for patients to interact with registry data to help make decisions. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a web-based system that uses a prostate cancer (CaP) registry to provide newly diagnosed men with a platform to view predicted treatment decisions based on patients with similar characteristics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) is a quality improvement consortium of urology practices that maintains a prospective registry of men with CaP. We used registry data from 45 MUSIC urology practices from 2015 to 2017 to develop and validate a random forest machine learning model. After fitting the random forest model to a derivation cohort consisting of a random two-thirds sample of patients after stratifying by practice location, we evaluated the model performance in a validation cohort consisting of the remaining one-third of patients using a multiclass area under the curve (AUC) measure and calibration plots. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We identified 7543 men diagnosed with CaP, of whom 45% underwent radical prostatectomy, 30% surveillance, 17% radiation therapy, 5.6% androgen deprivation, and 1.8% watchful waiting. The personalized prediction for patients in the validation cohort was highly accurate (AUC 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Using clinical registry data and machine learning methods, we created a web-based platform for patients that generates accurate predictions for most CaP treatments. PATIENT SUMMARY: We have developed and tested a tool to help men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer to view predicted treatment decisions based on similar patients from our registry. We have made this tool available online for patients to use.;0

Peroxiredoxins in Colorectal Cancer: Predictive Biomarkers of Radiation Response and Therapeutic Targets to Increase Radiation Sensitivity?;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the Western world, with one-third of cases located in the rectum. Preoperative radiotherapy is the standard of care for many patients with rectal cancer but has a highly variable response rate. The ability to predict response would be of great clinical utility. The response of cells to ionizing radiation is known to involve immediate damage to biomolecules and more sustained disruption of redox homeostasis leading to cell death. The peroxiredoxins are an important group of thiol-dependent antioxidants involved in protecting cells from oxidative stress and regulating signaling pathways involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress. All six human peroxiredoxins have shown increased expression in CRC and may be associated with clinicopathological features and tumor response to ionizing radiation. Peroxiredoxins can act as markers of oxidative stress in various biological systems but they have not been investigated in this capacity in CRC. As such, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the role of peroxiredoxins as clinical biomarkers, but it is an area worthy of investigation. Future research should focus on the in vivo response of rectal cancer to radiotherapy and the redox status of peroxiredoxins in rectal cancer cells, in order to predict response to radiotherapy. The peroxiredoxin system is also a potential therapeutic target for CRC.;0
Application of Constrained Optimization Methods in Health Services Research: Report 2 of the ISPOR Optimization Methods Emerging Good Practices Task Force.;BACKGROUND: Constrained optimization methods are already widely used in health care to solve problems that represent traditional applications of operations research methods, such as choosing the optimal location for new facilities or making the most efficient use of operating room capacity. OBJECTIVES: In this paper we illustrate the potential utility of these methods for finding optimal solutions to problems in health care delivery and policy. To do so, we selected three award-winning papers in health care delivery or policy development, reflecting a range of optimization algorithms. Two of the three papers are reviewed using the ISPOR Constrained Optimization Good Practice Checklist, adapted from the framework presented in the initial Optimization Task Force Report. The first case study illustrates application of linear programming to determine the optimal mix of screening and vaccination strategies for the prevention of cervical cancer. The second case illustrates application of the Markov Decision Process to find the optimal strategy for treating type 2 diabetes patients for hypercholesterolemia using statins. The third paper (described in Appendix 1) is used as an educational tool. The goal is to describe the characteristics of a radiation therapy optimization problem and then invite the reader to formulate the mathematical model for solving it. This example is particularly interesting because it lends itself to a range of possible models, including linear, nonlinear, and mixed-integer programming formulations. From the case studies presented, we hope the reader will develop an appreciation for the wide range of problem types that can be addressed with constrained optimization methods, as well as the variety of methods available. CONCLUSIONS: Constrained optimization methods are informative in providing insights to decision makers about optimal target solutions and the magnitude of the loss of benefit or increased costs associated with the ultimate clinical decision or policy choice. Failing to identify a mathematically superior or optimal solution represents a missed opportunity to improve economic efficiency in the delivery of care and clinical outcomes for patients. The ISPOR Optimization Methods Emerging Good Practices Task Force's first report provided an introduction to constrained optimization methods to solve important clinical and health policy problems. This report also outlined the relationship of constrained optimization methods relative to traditional health economic modeling, graphically illustrated a simple formulation, and identified some of the major variants of constrained optimization models, such as linear programming, dynamic programming, integer programming, and stochastic programming. The second report illustrates the application of constrained optimization methods in health care decision making using three case studies. The studies focus on determining optimal screening and vaccination strategies for cervical cancer, optimal statin start times for diabetes, and an educational case to invite the reader to formulate radiation therapy optimization problems. These illustrate a wide range of problem types that can be addressed with constrained optimization methods.;0
A smart and operator independent system to delineate tumours in Positron Emission Tomography scans.;"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging has an enormous potential to improve radiation therapy treatment planning offering complementary functional information with respect to other anatomical imaging approaches. The aim of this study is to develop an operator independent, reliable, and clinically feasible system for biological tumour volume delineation from PET images. Under this design hypothesis, we combine several known approaches in an original way to deploy a system with a high level of automation. The proposed system automatically identifies the optimal region of interest around the tumour and performs a slice-by-slice marching local active contour segmentation. It automatically stops when a ""cancer-free"" slice is identified. User intervention is limited at drawing an initial rough contour around the cancer region. By design, the algorithm performs the segmentation minimizing any dependence from the initial input, so that the final result is extremely repeatable. To assess the performances under different conditions, our system is evaluated on a dataset comprising five synthetic experiments and fifty oncological lesions located in different anatomical regions (i.e. lung, head and neck, and brain) using PET studies with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose and 11C-labeled Methionine radio-tracers. Results on synthetic lesions demonstrate enhanced performances when compared against the most common PET segmentation methods. In clinical cases, the proposed system produces accurate segmentations (average dice similarity coefficient: 85.36  2.94%, 85.98  3.40%, 88.02  2.75% in the lung, head and neck, and brain district, respectively) with high agreement with the gold standard (determination coefficient R2 = 0.98). We believe that the proposed system could be efficiently used in the everyday clinical routine as a medical decision tool, and to provide the clinicians with additional information, derived from PET, which can be of use in radiation therapy, treatment, and planning.

Interrogating the protein interactomes of RAS isoforms identifies PIP5K1A as a KRAS-specific vulnerability.;In human cancers, oncogenic mutations commonly occur in the RAS genes KRAS, NRAS, or HRAS, but there are no clinical RAS inhibitors. Mutations are more prevalent in KRAS, possibly suggesting a unique oncogenic activity mediated by KRAS-specific interaction partners, which might be targeted. Here, we determine the specific protein interactomes of each RAS isoform by BirA proximity-dependent biotin identification. The combined interactomes are screened by CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function assays for proteins required for oncogenic KRAS-dependent, NRAS-dependent, or HRAS-dependent proliferation and censored for druggable proteins. Using this strategy, we identify phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase PIP5K1A as a KRAS-specific interactor and show that PIP5K1A binds to a unique region in KRAS. Furthermore, PIP5K1A depletion specifically reduces oncogenic KRAS signaling and proliferation, and sensitizes pancreatic cancer cell lines to a MAPK inhibitor. These results suggest PIP5K1A as a potential target in KRAS signaling for the treatment of KRAS-mutant cancers.;0
Modeling Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy in Mice.;Figure 1. Main Applications of Mouse Models for Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy. Immunodeficient mice xenografted with human cancer cell lines have been at the foundation of in vivo cancer research for several decades, providing ground for the regulatory approval of multiple chemotherapeutics and targeted anticancer agents, but are intrinsically unsuitable for studying tumor immunology and immunotherapy. Similarly, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) established in immunodeficient mice are not subjected to immunosurveillance by the host, although (depending on the protocol employed for PDX generation) some components of the patient's immune system may also be transferred to the mouse and be active, at least for some time. Considerable efforts are being devoted to the generation of humanized mice to circumvent these limitations. The establishment of PDXs in immunodeficient mice that are also engrafted with matched patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is also being investigated as a means to screen for the efficacy of (immuno)therapeutic agents in support of clinical decision making. Mouse cancer cell lines grafted subcutaneously or orthotopically in immunocompetent syngeneic hosts have been instrumental for the development of a variety of immunotherapeutics, as well as for the discovery that conventional anticancer regimens, including some forms of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can trigger tumor-targeting immune responses. Carcinogen-driven tumors established in immunocompetent versus immunodeficient animals were critical in the early days of modern tumor immunology, as they enabled the discovery of natural anticancer immunosurveillance. Moreover, they allow for investigating the immunological versus non-immunological efficacy of anticancer (immuno)therapeutics in the context of natural immunoediting, clinically relevant immunobiological heterogeneity, and high mutation load. Transgene-driven tumors have generated in-depth insights into the crosstalk between oncogenic drivers and the tumor microenvironment, in both its immunological and non-immunological components. Each of these models is associated with specific advantages and disadvantages (see Key Facts). Figure 2. Key Features of Mouse Models for Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy. Key parameters that should be taken into careful consideration when choosing the most appropriate mouse model for the study of tumor immunology and immunotherapy include not only the immunological competence of the host (which is influenced by strain, sex, and age) and its immunological compatibility with malignant cells (which is dictated by strain), but also the mutational load of the latter, their immunological history (previous immunoediting), proliferative potential, propensity for neovascularization and metastatic dissemination, as well as their ability to generate an immunostimulatory versus immunosuppressive microenvironment. Inoculation site is also an important parameter to keep under consideration (not shown). The precise objective of each study dictates which specific combination of such features should be preferred.;0
Osimertinib for EGFR-Mutant Lung Cancer with Brain Metastases: Results from a Single-Center Retrospective Study.;INTRODUCTION: Osimertinib is a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, initially approved for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with T790M acquired resistance, and now approved in the first-line setting. However, data supporting the use of osimertinib in untreated brain metastases are limited, although it has established central nervous system (CNS) activity. Our study compares the clinical outcomes of patients experiencing progressing brain metastases treated with cranial irradiation and osimertinib with those treated with osimertinib alone. METHODS: Forty patients who were treated with osimertinib at the Stanford Cancer Center from November 2015 to December 2016 were identified by searching an electronic medical record database. Eleven patients had progressing brain metastases and did not receive radiation (group A), 9 patients had progressing brain metastases and received radiation when starting osimertinib (group B), and 20 patients had stable brain metastases at the time of initiating osimertinib (group C). Patient and disease characteristics, radiographic responses, and survival outcomes were evaluated retrospectively for the three groups. RESULTS: The CNS response rate was 32.3%. Median time to treatment failure (TTF), overall progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were 10.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5-11.8), 8.8 months (95% CI, 6.2-12.1), and 16.2 months, respectively. Median TTF was 15.1 months for group A (95% CI, 1.7-28.5), 7.7 months for group B (95% CI, 0-15.5), and 10.7 months for group C (95% CI, 9.0-12.5). The median PFS was 8.8 months for group A (95% CI, 4.3-13.4), not reached for group B, and 8.4 months for group C (95% CI, 5.6-11.1). The median OS was not reached for group A and C, and was 16.2 months for group B. There was no apparent difference in TTF, PFS, or OS between the three groups. CONCLUSION: Receiving radiation prior to starting osimertinib for patients with progressing brain metastases did not prolong TTF, PFS, or OS in our series. To minimize the risks of radiation-related toxicity, delaying radiation could be considered for some patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with brain metastases who initially respond to osimertinib in the second-line setting. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Osimertinib is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor recently approved for the first-line treatment of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer. Although it appears to have central nervous system (CNS) activity, most clinical trials have excluded patients with untreated, progressing brain metastases. This study included patients with stable and progressing CNS metastases treated with osimertinib and found no apparent differences in median time to treatment failure, time to progression, and overall survival in patients who received osimertinib alone compared with those who received osimertinib and radiosurgery. This may support a clinician's decision to defer radiation for selected patients with untreated brain metastases who are candidates for osimertinib therapy.;0
Early postsurgical diffusivity metrics for prognostication of long-term pain relief after Gamma Knife radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia.;OBJECTIVE: Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is an important treatment modality for trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Current longitudinal assessment after GKRS relies primarily on clinical diagnostic measures, which are highly limited in the prediction of long-term clinical benefit. An objective, noninvasive, predictive tool would be of great utility to advance the clinical management of patients. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the authors' aim was to determine whether early (6 months post-GKRS) target diffusivity metrics can be used to prognosticate long-term pain relief in patients with TN. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with TN treated with GKRS underwent 3T MRI scans at 6 months posttreatment. Diffusivity metrics of fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity were extracted bilaterally from the radiosurgical target of the affected trigeminal nerve and its contralateral, unaffected nerve. Early (6 months post-GKRS) diffusivity metrics were compared with long-term clinical outcome. Patients were identified as long-term responders if they achieved at least 75% reduction in preoperative pain for 12 months or longer following GKRS. RESULTS: Trigeminal nerve diffusivity at 6 months post-GKRS was predictive of long-term clinical effectiveness, where long-term responders (n = 19) showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy at the radiosurgical target of their affected nerve compared to their contralateral, unaffected nerve and to nonresponders. Radial diffusivity and mean diffusivity, correlates of myelin alterations and inflammation, were also significantly higher in the affected nerve of long-term responders compared to their unaffected nerve. Nonresponders (n = 18) did not exhibit any characteristic diffusivity changes after GKRS. CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrate that early postsurgical target diffusivity metrics have a translational, clinical value and permit prediction of long-term pain relief in patients with TN treated with GKRS. Importantly, an association was found between the footprint of radiation and clinical effectiveness, where a sufficient level of microstructural change at the radiosurgical target is necessary for long-lasting pain relief. DTI can provide prognostic information that supplements clinical measures, and thus may better guide the postoperative assessment and clinical decision-making for patients with TN.;0
Application of 21-gene recurrence score results and ASTRO suitability criteria in breast cancer patients treated with intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT).;BACKGROUND: American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) suitability criteria for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) and the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) were evaluated for prognostic and predictive benefit in IORT patients. METHODS: Outcomes of 184 patients completing IRB approved IORT protocol were retrospectively reviewed. Data included demographics, histopathology, RS, adjuvant therapy, locoregional (LRR) and distant recurrences (DR), and breast cancer-specific survival. RESULTS: There were 10 (5.4%) breast cancer recurrences, including one breast cancer-specific death. All 184 patients were classified by ASTRO suitability criteria (suitable: 64% (5 LRR), cautionary: 30% (3 LRR), unsuitable: 6.0% (1 LRR, 1 DR leading to death). RS were available in 114 estrogen receptor positive patients (<11: 22% (1 LRR), 11-25: 63% (1 LRR), 26-30: 9%, >30: 6%). Mean follow-up was 55 months. CONCLUSIONS: ASTRO suitability criteria for APBI and RS were useful in making prognostic and therapeutic recommendations for patients considering IORT.;0
Management of patients with advanced prostate cancer in the Asia Pacific region: 'real-world' consideration of results from the Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) 2017.;OBJECTIVE: The Asia Pacific Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APAC APCCC 2018) brought together 20 experts from 15 APAC countries to discuss the real-world application of consensus statements from the second APCCC held in St Gallen in 2017 (APCCC 2017). FINDINGS: Differences in genetics, environment, lifestyle, diet and culture are all likely to influence the management of advanced prostate cancer in the APAC region when compared with the rest of the world. When considering the strong APCCC 2017 recommendation for the use of upfront docetaxel in metastatic castration-naive prostate cancer, the panel noted possible increased toxicity in Asian men receiving docetaxel, which would affect this recommendation in the APAC region. Although androgen receptor-targeting agents appear to be well tolerated in Asian men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, access to these drugs is very limited for financial reasons across the region. The meeting highlighted that cost and access to contemporary treatments and technologies are key factors influencing therapeutic decision-making in the APAC region. Whilst lower cost/older treatments and technologies may be an option, issues of culture and patient or physician preference mean, these may not always be acceptable. Although generic products can reduce cost in some countries, costs may still be prohibitive for lower-income patients or communities. The panellists noted the opportunity for a coordinated approach across the APAC region to address issues of access and cost. Developments in technologies and treatments are presenting new opportunities for the diagnosis and treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Differences in genetics and epidemiology affect the side-effect profiles of some drugs and influence prescribing. CONCLUSIONS: As the field continues to evolve, collaboration across the APAC region will be important to facilitate relevant research and collection and appraisal of data relevant to APAC populations. In the meantime, the APAC APCCC 2018 meeting highlighted the critical importance of a multidisciplinary team-based approach to treatment planning and care, delivery of best-practice care by clinicians with appropriate expertise, and the importance of patient information and support for informed patient choice.;0
Pre-therapy Somatostatin Receptor-Based Heterogeneity Predicts Overall Survival in Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor Patients Undergoing Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy.;"PURPOSE: Early identification of aggressive disease could improve decision support in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) patients prior to peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). The prognostic value of intratumoral textural features (TF) determined by baseline somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-positron emission tomography (PET) before PRRT was analyzed. PROCEDURES: Thirty-one patients with G1/G2 pNET were enrolled (G2, n = 23/31). Prior to PRRT with [(177)Lu]DOTATATE (mean, 3.6 cycles), baseline SSTR-PET computed tomography was performed. By segmentation of 162 (median per patient, 5) metastases, intratumoral TF were computed. The impact of conventional PET parameters (SUV(mean/max)), imaging-based TF, and clinical parameters (Ki67, CgA) for prediction of both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after PRRT were evaluated. RESULTS: Within a median follow-up of 3.7 years, tumor progression was detected in 21 patients (median, 1.5 years) and 13/31 deceased (median, 1.9 years). In ROC analysis, the TF entropy, reflecting derangement on a voxel-by-voxel level, demonstrated predictive capability for OS (cutoff = 6.7, AUC = 0.71, p = 0.02). Of note, increasing entropy could predict a longer survival (> 6.7, OS = 2.5 years, 17/31), whereas less voxel-based derangement portended inferior outcome (< 6.7, OS = 1.9 years, 14/31). These findings were supported in a G2 subanalysis (> 6.9, OS = 2.8 years, 9/23 vs. < 6.9, OS = 1.9 years, 14/23). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant distinction between high- and low-risk groups using entropy (n = 31, p < 0.05). For those patients below the ROC-derived threshold, the relative risk of death after PRRT was 2.73 (n = 31, p = 0.04). Ki67 was negatively associated with PFS (p = 0.002); however, SUV(mean/max) failed in prognostication (n.s.). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to conventional PET parameters, assessment of intratumoral heterogeneity demonstrated superior prognostic performance in pNET patients undergoing PRRT. This novel PET-based strategy of outcome prediction prior to PRRT might be useful for patient risk stratification.";0
Clinical Impact of Preoperative Albumin-Globulin Ratio in Patients with Rectal Cancer Treated with Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy.;OBJECTIVE: The serum albumin-globulin ratio (AGR) is associated with malignancy outcomes. However, among patients with rectal cancer (RC) who undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), the clinical and prognostic significance of the pretreatment AGR is unclear. METHODS: We investigated whether the pre-nCRT AGR can help predict oncological outcomes in patients with RC receiving nCRT. We analyzed 114 patients with RC who received nCRT followed by total mesorectal excision at our institution. RESULTS: A lower AGR in pre-nCRT serum was significantly correlated with shorter overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with nCRT-treated RC. In multivariate analysis, a high carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level and a low AGR in pre-nCRT serum were independent predictors of a poor prognosis in these patients. Furthermore, combining the AGR with CEA provided a more accurate indicator of poor prognosis and early recurrence in these patients. In particular, a low pre-nCRT AGR was a stronger indicator of a poor prognosis and early recurrence in patients without than with pathological lymph node metastasis. Combining the pre-nCRT AGR with CEA could more precisely stratify patients' oncological outcome risks. CONCLUSION: Assessment of the pretreatment AGR with or without CEA can guide postoperative treatment in patients with RC who undergo nCRT.;0
Using a geriatric oncology assessment to link with services (GOAL).;"OBJECTIVE: Geriatric screening tools assess functional limitations and inform clinical decision-making for older adults with cancer. Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a screener in community-based oncology clinics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were from two rural, underserved community-based cancer clinics; within 12months of a cancer diagnosis (breast, lung, colorectal, pancreas, esophageal); aged >/=60years; and not exclusively pursuing palliative care. We used a previously validated tool that was embedded in the electronic health record (EHR). Patient-reported responses identified memory impairment, depressive symptoms, deficits in activities of daily living, poor nutrition, and polypharmacy. At the discretion of the oncologist, responses prompted service referrals. From the EHR, we extracted information about referrals and completion of planned therapy. We present descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Enrolled patients (n=44) had a mean age of 71.5years (SD=6.9). Most were non-white (61%), women (66%), with government-sponsored health insurance (80%). The most commonly identified geriatric syndromes: polypharmacy (89%), reduced quality of life (39%), and poor nutrition (39%). The screener triggered a referral in 98% of patients. Generated referrals were for depressive symptoms (52% needed, 39% received), nutrition (43% needed, 37% received), and polypharmacy (89% needed, 26% received). Patients were referred to social work (56%), nutrition (44%), and pharmacy (25%). Many patients completed planned radiation therapy (100%), surgery (70%), and chemotherapy (60%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of an EHR-embedded brief geriatric oncology assessment in rural oncology clinics identified geriatric syndromes that would benefit from provision of services in nearly all enrolled patients.

Development of an isotoxic decision support system integrating genetic markers of toxicity for the implantation of a rectum spacer.;INTRODUCTION: Previous studies revealed that dose escalated radiotherapy for prostate cancer patients leads to higher tumor control probabilities (TCP) but also to higher rectal toxicities. An isotoxic model was developed to maximize the given dose while controlling the toxicity level. This was applied to analyze the effect of an implantable rectum spacer (IRS) and extended with a genetic test of normal tissue radio-sensitivity. A virtual IRS (V-IRS) was tested using this method. We hypothesized that the patients with increased risk of toxicity would benefit more from an IRS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen localized prostate cancer patients implanted with an IRS were included in the study. Treatment planning was performed on computed tomography (CT) images before and after the placement of the IRS and with a V-IRS. The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) was calculated using a QUANTEC reviewed model for Grade > =2 late rectal bleeding and the number of fractions of the plans were adjusted until the NTCP value was under 5%. The resulting treatment plans were used to calculate the TCP before and after placement of an IRS. This was extended by adding the effect of two published genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) for late rectal bleeding. RESULTS: The median TCP resulting from the optimized plans in patients before the IRS was 75.1% [32.6-90.5%]. With IRS, the median TCP is significantly higher: 98.9% [80.8-99.9%] (p < .01). The difference in TCP between the V-IRS and the real IRS was 1.8% [0.0-18.0%]. Placing an IRS in the patients with SNP's improved the TCP from 49.0% [16.1-80.8%] and 48.9% [16.0-72.8%] to 96.3% [67.0-99.5%] and 90.1% [49.0-99.5%] (p < .01) respectively for either SNP. CONCLUSION: This study was a proof-of-concept for an isotoxic model with genetic biomarkers with a V-IRS as a multifactorial decision support system for the decision of a placement of an IRS.;0
Describing perspectives of health care professionals on active surveillance for the management of prostate cancer.;BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, active surveillance has proven to be a safe approach for patients with low-risk prostate cancer. Although active surveillance presents several advantages for both patients and the health care system, all eligible patients do not adopt this approach. Our goal was to evaluate the factors that influence physicians to recommend active surveillance and the barriers that impact adherence to this approach. METHODS: Focus groups (n = 5) were held with physicians who provided care for men with low-risk prostate cancer and had engaged in conversations with men and their families about active surveillance. The experience of health care professionals (HCPs) was captured to understand their decisions in proposing active surveillance and to reveal the barriers and facilitators that affect the adherence to this approach. A content analysis was performed on the verbatim transcripts from the sessions. RESULTS: Although physicians agreed that active surveillance is a suitable approach for low-risk prostate cancer patients, they were concerned about the rapidly evolving and non-standardized guidelines for patient follow-up. They pointed out the need for additional tools to appropriately identify proper patients for whom active surveillance is the best option. Urologists and radiation-oncologists were keen to collaborate with each other, but the role of general practitioner remained controversial once patients were referred to a specialist. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of more reliable tools and/or markers in addition to more specific guidelines for patient follow-up would increase the confidence of both patients and physicians in the choice of active surveillance.;0
Cost-effectiveness of afatinib and erlotinib as second-line treatments for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.;AIM: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of afatinib and erlotinib as second-line therapy for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. MATERIALS & METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed for projecting the economic outcomes. Clinical parameters and utilities were from the LUX-Lung 8 trial. Costs were mainly estimated from the Chinese health system. The outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: The afatinib strategy generated additional 0.154 quality-adjusted life-years compared with erlotinib, with incremental costs of  yen16,852. Relative to erlotinib, afatinib resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of  yen109,429 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The overall survival time of afatinib had a considerable impact on the model outcomes. CONCLUSION: Afatinib is a cost-effective treatment option compared with erlotinib in patients with squamous cell carcinoma.;0
Understanding Medical Decision-making in Prostate Cancer Care.;The availability of several treatment options for prostate cancer creates a situation where patients may need to come to a shared decision with their health-care team regarding their care. Shared decision-making (SDM) is the concept of a patient and a health-care professional collaborating to make decisions about the patient's treatment course. Nurse navigators (NNs) are health-care professionals often involved in the SDM process. The current project sought to evaluate the way in which patients with prostate cancer make decisions regarding their care and to determine patients' perspectives of the role of the NN in the SDM process. Eleven participants were recruited from the Prostate Assessment Centre by a NN. They were interviewed via telephone and their responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. Five interacting factors were determined to influence the way participants made decisions including level of anxiety, desire to maintain normalcy, support system quality, exposure to cancer narratives, and extent of practical concerns. NNs were found to increase knowledge, decrease indecision, and provide reassurance for participants. Based on the beneficial aspects of NN interaction reported in this study, the use of NNs in SDM programs should be encouraged. The results of the study demonstrate the complexity of the decision-making process when it comes to prostate cancer treatment. The factors elucidated in the study should be considered during the development and implementation of prostate cancer SDM programs.;0
A multiobjective Bayesian networks approach for joint prediction of tumor local control and radiation pneumonitis in nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for response-adapted radiotherapy.;PURPOSE: Individualization of therapeutic outcomes in NSCLC radiotherapy is likely to be compromised by the lack of proper balance of biophysical factors affecting both tumor local control (LC) and side effects such as radiation pneumonitis (RP), which are likely to be intertwined. Here, we compare the performance of separate and joint outcomes predictions for response-adapted personalized treatment planning. METHODS: A total of 118 NSCLC patients treated on prospective protocols with 32 cases of local progression and 20 cases of RP grade 2 or higher (RP2) were studied. Sixty-eight patients with 297 features before and during radiotherapy were used for discovery and 50 patients were reserved for independent testing. A multiobjective Bayesian network (MO-BN) approach was developed to identify important features for joint LC/RP2 prediction using extended Markov blankets as inputs to develop a BN predictive structure. Cross-validation (CV) was used to guide the MO-BN structure learning. Area under the free-response receiver operating characteristic (AU-FROC) curve was used to evaluate joint prediction performance. RESULTS: Important features including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), micro RNAs, pretreatment cytokines, pretreatment PET radiomics together with lung and tumor gEUDs were selected and their biophysical inter-relationships with radiation outcomes (LC and RP2) were identified in a pretreatment MO-BN. The joint LC/RP2 prediction yielded an AU-FROC of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70-0.86) upon internal CV. This improved to 0.85 (0.75-0.91) with additional two SNPs, changes in one cytokine and two radiomics PET image features through the course of radiotherapy in a during-treatment MO-BN. This MO-BN model outperformed combined single-objective Bayesian networks (SO-BNs) during-treatment [0.78 (0.67-0.84)]. AU-FROC values in the evaluation of the MO-BN and individual SO-BNs on the testing dataset were 0.77 and 0.68 for pretreatment, and 0.79 and 0.71 for during-treatment, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MO-BNs can reveal possible biophysical cross-talks between competing radiotherapy clinical endpoints. The prediction is improved by providing additional during-treatment information. The developed MO-BNs can be an important component of decision support systems for personalized response-adapted radiotherapy.;0
Lung IMRT planning with automatic determination of beam angle configurations.;Beam angle configuration is a major planning decision in intensity modulated radiation treatment (IMRT) that has a significant impact on dose distributions and thus quality of treatment, especially in complex planning cases such as those for lung cancer treatment. We propose a novel method to automatically determine beam configurations that incorporates noncoplanar beams. We then present a completely automated IMRT planning algorithm that combines the proposed method with a previously reported OAR DVH prediction model. Finally, we validate this completely automatic planning algorithm using a set of challenging lung IMRT cases. A beam efficiency index map is constructed to guide the selection of beam angles. This index takes into account both the dose contributions from individual beams and the combined effect of multiple beams by introducing a beam-spread term. The effect of the beam-spread term on plan quality was studied systematically and the weight of the term to balance PTV dose conformity against OAR avoidance was determined. For validation, complex lung cases with clinical IMRT plans that required the use of one or more noncoplanar beams were re-planned with the proposed automatic planning algorithm. Important dose metrics for the PTV and OARs in the automatic plans were compared with those of the clinical plans. The results are very encouraging. The PTV dose conformity and homogeneity in the automatic plans improved significantly. And all the dose metrics of the automatic plans, except the lung V(5 Gy), were statistically better than or comparable with those of the clinical plans. In conclusion, the automatic planning algorithm can incorporate non-coplanar beam configurations in challenging lung cases and can generate plans efficiently with quality closely approximating that of clinical plans.;0
Development of a simplified multivariable model to predict neutropenic complications in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.;PURPOSE: Neutropenic complications remain the major dose-limiting toxicities of cancer chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to develop and internally validate a comprehensive and easily measurable scoring system for prediction of severe or febrile neutropenia in the first chemotherapy cycle of patients with solid tumors or lymphoma. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included consecutive patients at a tertiary referral hospital. Many clinical and laboratory-independent variables were measured at baseline. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied after unadjusted analysis, and the multivariable model was transformed into a simplified risk score based on 6 bootstrapped regression coefficients. The simplified scoring system was internally validated using cross-validation. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: A total of 305 patients were enrolled and followed during 1732 chemotherapy cycles. Of these, 259 were eligible for analysis. The multivariable model revealed 6 predictive factors for severe or febrile neutropenia (scores in parentheses): high-risk regimen without colony-stimulating factor (4 points), intermediate-risk regimen without colony-stimulating factor (3 points), age > 65 years and elevated ferritin (3 points), body mass index < 23 kg/m(2) and body surface area < 2 m(2) (2 points), estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73m(2) (2 points), and elevated C-reactive protein (1 point). The receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.832 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.767-0.897) for the simplified model and 0.816 (95% Cl, 0.771-0.860) for the cross-validation. CONCLUSIONS: We developed and internally validated a user-friendly prediction model to guide personalized decision-making using available clinical data and few cost-effective laboratory tests. External validation in other centers with different patients is required.;0
Using Big Data Analytics to Advance Precision Radiation Oncology.;Big clinical data analytics as a primary component of precision medicine is discussed, identifying where these emerging tools fit in the spectrum of genomics and radiomics research. A learning health system (LHS) is conceptualized that uses clinically acquired data with machine learning to advance the initiatives of precision medicine. The LHS is comprehensive and can be used for clinical decision support, discovery, and hypothesis derivation. These developing uses can positively impact the ultimate management and therapeutic course for patients. The conceptual model for each use of clinical data, however, is different, and an overview of the implications is discussed. With advancements in technologies and culture to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and breadth of measurements of the patient condition, the concept of an LHS may be realized in precision radiation therapy.;0
A prospective randomized multicentre study of the impact of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT imaging for staging high-risk prostate cancer prior to curative-intent surgery or radiotherapy (proPSMA study): clinical trial protocol.;"BACKGROUND: Accurate staging of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) is important for therapeutic decision-making. Relapse after surgery or radiotherapy of curative intent is not uncommon and, in part, represents a failure of staging with current diagnostic imaging techniques to detect disease spread. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron-emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is a new whole-body scanning technique that enables visualization of PCa with high contrast. The hypotheses of this study are that: (i) PSMA-PET/CT has improved diagnostic performance compared with conventional imaging; (ii) PSMA-PET/CT should be used as a first-line diagnostic test for staging; (iii) the improved diagnostic performance of PSMA-PET/CT will result in significant management impact; and (iv) there are economic benefits if PSMA-PET/CT is incorporated into the management algorithm. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The proPSMA trial is a prospective, multicentre study in which patients with untreated high-risk PCa will be randomized to gallium-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT or conventional imaging, consisting of CT of the abdomen/pelvis and bone scintigraphy with single-photon emission CT/CT. Patients eligible for inclusion are those with newly diagnosed PCa with select high-risk features, defined as International Society of Urological Pathology grade group >/=3 (primary Gleason grade 4, or any Gleason grade 5), prostate-specific antigen level >/=20 ng/mL or clinical stage >/=T3. Patients with negative, equivocal or oligometastatic disease on first line-imaging will cross over to receive the other imaging arm. The primary objective is to compare the accuracy of PSMA-PET/CT with that of conventional imaging for detecting nodal or distant metastatic disease. Histopathological, imaging and clinical follow-up at 6 months will define the primary endpoint according to a predefined scoring system. Secondary objectives include comparing management impact, the number of equivocal studies, the incremental value of second-line imaging in patients who cross over, the cost of each imaging strategy, radiation exposure, inter-observer agreement and safety of PSMA-PET/CT. Longer-term follow-up will also assess the prognostic value of a negative PSMA-PET/CT. OUTCOME AND SIGNIFICANCE: This trial will provide data to establish whether PSMA-PET/CT should replace conventional imaging in the primary staging of select high-risk localized PCa, or whether it should be used to provide incremental diagnostic information in selected cases.";0
Thermal liquid biopsy for monitoring melanoma patients under surveillance during treatment: A pilot study.;BACKGROUND: Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) is a technique traditionally used to study thermally induced macromolecular transitions, and it has recently been proposed as a novel approach for diagnosis and monitoring of several diseases. We report a pilot study applying Thermal Liquid Biopsy (TLB, DSC thermograms of plasma samples) as a new clinical approach for diagnostic assessment of melanoma patients. METHODS: Multiparametric analysis of DSC thermograms of patient plasma samples collected during treatment and surveillance (63 samples from 10 patients) were compared with clinical and diagnostic imaging assessment to determine the utility of thermograms for diagnostic assessment in melanoma. Nine of the ten patients were stage 2 or 3 melanoma subjects receiving adjuvant therapy after surgical resection of their melanomas. The other patient had unresectable stage 4 melanoma and was treated with immunotherapy. Two reference groups were used: (A) 36 healthy subjects and (B) 13 samples from 8 melanoma patients who had completed successful surgical management of their disease and were determined by continued clinical assessment to have no evidence of disease. RESULTS: Plasma thermogram analysis applied to melanoma patients generally agrees with clinical evaluation determined by physical assessment or diagnostic imaging (~80% agreement). No false negatives were obtained from DSC thermograms. Importantly, this methodology was able to detect changes in disease status before it was identified clinically. CONCLUSIONS: Thermal Liquid Biopsy could be used in combination with current clinical assessment for the earlier detection of melanoma recurrence and metastasis. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: TLB offers advantages over current diagnostic techniques (PET/CT imaging), limited in frequency by radiation burden and expense, in providing a minimally-invasive, low-risk, low-cost clinical test for more frequent personalized patient monitoring to assess recurrence and facilitate clinical decision-making.;0
Patient views and correlates of radiotherapy omission in a population-based sample of older women with favorable-prognosis breast cancer.;"BACKGROUND: The omission of radiotherapy (RT) after lumpectomy is a reasonable option for many older women with favorable-prognosis breast cancer. In the current study, we sought to evaluate patient perspectives regarding decision making about RT. METHODS: Women aged 65 to 79 years with AJCC 7th edition stage I and II breast cancer who were reported to the Georgia and Los Angeles County Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries were surveyed (response rate, 70%) regarding RT decisions, the rationale for omitting RT, decision-making values, and understanding of disease recurrence risk. We also surveyed their corresponding surgeons (response rate, 77%). Patient characteristics associated with the omission of RT were evaluated using multilevel, multivariable logistic regression, accounting for patient clustering within surgeons. RESULTS: Of 999 patients, 135 omitted RT (14%). Older age, lower tumor grade, and having estrogen receptor-positive disease each were found to be strongly associated with omission of RT in multivariable analyses, whereas the number of comorbidities was not. Non-English speakers were more likely to omit RT (adjusted odds ratio, 5.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-24.5). The most commonly reported reasons for RT omission were that a physician advised the patient that it was not needed (54% of patients who omitted RT) and patient choice (41%). Risk of local disease recurrence was overestimated by all patients: by approximately 2-fold among those who omitted RT and by approximately 8-fold among those who received RT. The risk of distant disease recurrence was overestimated by approximately 3-fold on average. CONCLUSIONS: To some extent, decisions regarding RT omission are appropriately influenced by patient age, tumor grade, and estrogen receptor status, but do not appear to be optimally tailored according to competing comorbidities. Many women who are candidates for RT omission overestimate their risk of disease recurrence. Cancer 2018;124:2714-2723. (c) 2018 American Cancer Society.";0
The impact of [(68)Ga]PSMA I&T PET/CT on radiotherapy planning in patients with prostate cancer.;PURPOSE: To determine the impact of Gallium-68-labled prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography/computed tomography ([(68)Ga]PSMA PET/CT) on radiotherapy planning for primary disease, biochemical cancer relapse, and advanced disease of prostate cancer. METHODS: A total of 106 patients with prostate cancer scheduled for radiation therapy underwent 120 [(68)Ga]PSMA PET/CT scans prior to radiotherapy treatment. In 20 cases, patients underwent [(68)Ga]PSMA PET/CT for primary therapy (PT), 75 cases were referred for biochemical relapse after surgery (RL), and 25 cases were intended for palliative treatment of localized metastases (MD). We retrospectively compared the impact of [(68)Ga]PSMA PET/CT on lesion detection and treatment decision to CT alone. RESULTS: [(68)Ga]PSMA PET/CT revealed a total of 271 positive lesions, whereas CT detected 86 lesions (32%). Overall, the radiotherapy regime was changed in 55 of 120 cases (46%) based on the higher detection rate of [(68)Ga]PSMA PET/CT: in 15% of cases with PT, in 43% of cases with RL, and in 44% of cases with MD. CONCLUSION: [(68)Ga]PSMA PET/CT is superior to CT alone for lesion detection in prostate cancer, thereby significantly impacting on radiotherapy planning for primary disease, biochemical cancer relapse, and advanced disease of prostate cancer.;0
Online advertising and marketing claims by providers of proton beam therapy: are they guideline-based?;BACKGROUND: Cancer patients frequently search the Internet for treatment options, and hospital websites are seen as reliable sources of knowledge. Guidelines support the use of proton radiotherapy in specific disease sites or on clinical trials. This study aims to evaluate direct-to-consumer advertising content and claims made by proton therapy centre (PTC) websites worldwide. METHODS: Operational PTC websites in English were identified through the Particle Therapy Co-Operative Group website. Data abstraction of website content was performed independently by two investigators. Eight international guidelines were consulted to determine guideline-based indications for proton radiotherapy. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the characteristics of PTC websites that indicated proton radiotherapy offered greater disease control or cure rates. RESULTS: Forty-eight PTCs with 46 English websites were identified. 60.9% of PTC websites claimed proton therapy provided improved disease control or cure. U.S. websites listed more indications than international websites (15.5 +/- 5.4 vs. 10.4 +/- 5.8, p = 0.004). The most common disease sites advertised were prostate (87.0%), head and neck (87.0%) and pediatrics (82.6%), all of which were indicated in least one international guideline. Several disease sites advertised were not present in any consensus guidelines, including pancreatobiliary (52.2%), breast (50.0%), and esophageal (43.5%) cancers. Multivariate analysis found increasing number of disease sites and claiming their centre was a local or regional leader in proton radiotherapy was associated with indicating proton radiotherapy offers greater disease control or cure. CONCLUSIONS: Information from PTC websites often differs from recommendations found in international consensus guidelines. As online marketing information may have significant influence on patient decision-making, alignment of such information with accepted guidelines and consensus opinion should be adopted by PTC providers.;0
A new standardized data collection system for interdisciplinary thyroid cancer management: Thyroid COBRA.;"The big data approach offers a powerful alternative to Evidence-based medicine. This approach could guide cancer management thanks to machine learning application to large-scale data. Aim of the Thyroid CoBRA (Consortium for Brachytherapy Data Analysis) project is to develop a standardized web data collection system, focused on thyroid cancer. The Metabolic Radiotherapy Working Group of Italian Association of Radiation Oncology (AIRO) endorsed the implementation of a consortium directed to thyroid cancer management and data collection. The agreement conditions, the ontology of the collected data and the related software services were defined by a multicentre ad hoc working-group (WG). Six Italian cancer centres were firstly started the project, defined and signed the Thyroid COBRA consortium agreement. Three data set tiers were identified: Registry, Procedures and Research. The COBRA-Storage System (C-SS) appeared to be not time-consuming and to be privacy respecting, as data can be extracted directly from the single centre's storage platforms through a secured connection that ensures reliable encryption of sensible data. Automatic data archiving could be directly performed from Image Hospital Storage System or the Radiotherapy Treatment Planning Systems. The C-SS architecture will allow ""Cloud storage way"" or ""distributed learning"" approaches for predictive model definition and further clinical decision support tools development. The development of the Thyroid COBRA data Storage System C-SS through a multicentre consortium approach appeared to be a feasible tool in the setup of complex and privacy saving data sharing system oriented to the management of thyroid cancer and in the near future every cancer type.";0
Practical data collection and extraction for big data applications in radiotherapy.;The capture of high-quality treatment data and outcomes is necessary in order to learn from our clinical experiences with big data analytics. In radiotherapy, there are several practical challenges to overcome. Practical aspects of data collection are discussed pointing to a need for a culture change in clinical practice to one that captures structured patient-related data in routine care in a prospective manner. Radiation dosimetry and the contoured anatomy must also be captured routinely to represent the best estimate of delivered radiation. The quality and integrity present in the data are critical which poses opportunities to introduce electronic validity checking to improve them. Similarly, data completeness and methods and technology to improve the efficiency and sufficiency of data capture can be introduced. In the manuscript, the types of clinical data are discussed including patient reports, images, biospecimens, treatments, and symptom management. With a data-driven culture, the realization of a learning health system is possible unlocking the potential of big data and its influence on clinical decision-making and hypothesis generation.;0
Impact of a clinical pathway tool on appropriate palliative radiation therapy for bone metastases.;PURPOSE: Clinical pathways increase compliance with treatment guidelines, improve outcomes, and reduce costs. Guidelines recommend single fraction radiation therapy (SFRT) for palliation of uncomplicated bone metastases, but implementation is variable. We examined the effects of a pathway tool on SFRT rates in an academic radiation oncology practice. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using published literature, clinical guidelines, and expert input, we designed a clinical pathway for bone metastases radiation therapy displayed on a Web-based electronic interface. In March 2016, the pathway launched on a palliative radiation service at the Dana Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center main campus and at affiliated community sites. Providers were surveyed pre- and postimplementation to assess expectations and elicit feedback. Rates of pathway utilization, compliance with SFRT recommendations, and reasons for noncompliance were assessed. RESULTS: The final pathway includes 20 endpoints and several validated prognostic scoring systems. It was used in 38% of 723 bone metastases radiation prescriptions, with appropriate SFRT rates rising from 18% before implementation to 48% after launch (P < .01). Major reasons for rejecting recommendations included disagreement with life expectancy prognostication and patient convenience. The pathway increased physicians' confidence regarding compliance with treatment guidelines and made it easier to find well-supported treatment recommendations. Workflow disruptions and the inability to handle nuanced situations emerged as limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience demonstrates the utility of clinical pathway decision support for bone metastases radiation in complex academic settings. Next steps include increasing the pathway's ease of use, refining the pathway's prognostic abilities, and measuring cost savings related to the pathway.;0
Serial circulating tumour DNA analysis during multimodality treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer: a prospective biomarker study.;"OBJECTIVE: For patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), adjuvant chemotherapy selection following surgery remains a major clinical dilemma. Here, we investigated the ability of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) to improve risk stratification in patients with LARC. DESIGN: We enrolled patients with LARC (T3/T4 and/or N+) planned for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Plasma samples were collected pretreatment, postchemoradiotherapy and 4-10 weeks after surgery. Somatic mutations in individual patient's tumour were identified via massively parallel sequencing of 15 genes commonly mutated in colorectal cancer. We then designed personalised assays to quantify ctDNA in plasma samples. Patients received adjuvant therapy at clinician discretion, blinded to the ctDNA results. RESULTS: We analysed 462 serial plasma samples from 159 patients. ctDNA was detectable in 77%, 8.3% and 12% of pretreatment, postchemoradiotherapy and postsurgery plasma samples. Significantly worse recurrence-free survival was seen if ctDNA was detectable after chemoradiotherapy (HR 6.6; P<0.001) or after surgery (HR 13.0; P<0.001). The estimated 3-year recurrence-free survival was 33% for the postoperative ctDNA-positive patients and 87% for the postoperative ctDNA-negative patients. Postoperative ctDNA detection was predictive of recurrence irrespective of adjuvant chemotherapy use (chemotherapy: HR 10.0; P<0.001; without chemotherapy: HR 22.0; P<0.001). Postoperative ctDNA status remained an independent predictor of recurrence-free survival after adjusting for known clinicopathological risk factors (HR 6.0; P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Postoperative ctDNA analysis stratifies patients with LARC into subsets that are either at very high or at low risk of recurrence, independent of conventional clinicopathological risk factors. ctDNA analysis could potentially be used to guide patient selection for adjuvant chemotherapy.";0
Guidelines for medical management of nuclear/radiation emergencies.;Management of victim of radiation injury poses a wide spectrum of challenges to the health care provider starting with the evaluation of the damage, the kind of hospitalization and treatment and the regular monitoring of the patient. Undesirable clinical outcomes are probable if prodromal stage evolves rapidly and is severe. Critical systems like neurovascular, gastrointestinal, haematopoietic and cutaneous are afflicted in Acute Radiation Syndrome. Three main elements which are essential for assessment of prognosis and selection of treatment are vomiting onset time, kinetics of depletion of lymphocyte, and chromosome abnormalities. Larger incidents warrant, a well-structured national response system. Health care institutions must develop protocols to respond to radiation exposure related emergencies in tandem with the local response teams. Multidisciplinary approach between clinical specialists, nursing staff and psychological experts is of critical significance. External decontamination, estimation of dose and fluid and electrolyte replacements form part of support therapy. Reverse isolation, antacids, H2 blockers, use of reverse barrier nursing and prophylactic antimicrobials are part of the treatment plan. Patients with severe bone marrow damage will require blood products support. Increased recovery of neutrophils in radiationaccident victims is the rationale for the use of Colony Stimulating Factors. New directions are under evaluation which includes novel cytokine therapies like interleukin-7, keratinocyte growth factor, and thrombopoietin or its analogues. The final decision regarding allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplant should be considered after considering the irradiation source, particularity of the situations or circumstances, associated injuries and disease.;0
The effect of imputing missing clinical attribute values on training lung cancer survival prediction model performance.;According to the estimations of the World Health Organization and the International Agency for Research in Cancer, lung cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer worldwide. The last few years have witnessed a rise in the attention given to the use of clinical decision support systems in medicine generally and in cancer in particular. These can predict patients' likelihood of survival based on analysis of and learning from previously treated patients. The datasets that are mined for developing clinical decision support functionality are often incomplete, which adversely impacts the quality of the models developed and the decision support offered. Imputing missing data using a statistical analysis approach is a common method to addressing the missing data problem. This work investigates the effect of imputation methods for missing data in preparing a training dataset for a Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer survival prediction model using several machine learning algorithms. The investigation includes an assessment of the effect of imputation algorithm error on performance prediction and also a comparison between using a smaller complete real dataset or a larger dataset with imputed data. Our results show that even when the proportion of records with some missing data is very high (> 80%) imputation can lead to prediction models with an AUC (0.68-0.72) comparable to those trained with complete data records.;0
Patient-clinician communication among patients with stage I lung cancer.;"PURPOSE: Limited data exist about patient-centered communication (PCC) and patient-centered outcomes among patients who undergo surgery or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to examine the relationship between PCC and decision-making processes among NSCLC patients, using baseline data from a prospective, multicenter study. METHODS: Patients with stage 1 NSCLC completed a survey prior to treatment initiation. The survey assessed sociodemographic characteristics, treatment decision variables, and patient psychosocial outcomes: health-related quality of life (HRQOL), treatment self-efficacy, decisional conflict, and PCC. RESULTS: Fifty-two percent (n = 85) of 165 individuals planned to receive SBRT. There were no baseline differences detected on patient psychosocial outcomes between those who planned to receive SBRT or surgery. All participants reported high HRQOL (M = 72.5, SD = 21.3) out of 100, where higher scores indicate better functioning; high self-efficacy (M = 1.5, SD = 0.5) out of 6, where lower numbers indicate higher self-efficacy; minimal decisional conflict (M = 15.2, SD = 12.7) out of 100, where higher scores indicate higher decisional conflict; and high levels of patient-centered communication (M = 2.4, SD = 0.8) out of 7 where higher scores indicate worse communication. Linear regression analyses adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical variables showed that higher quality PCC was associated with higher self-efficacy (beta = 0.17, p = 0.03) and lower decisional conflict (beta = 0.42, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher quality PCC was associated with higher self-efficacy and lower decisional conflict. Self-efficacy and decisional conflict may influence subsequent health outcomes. Therefore, our findings may inform future research and clinical programs that focus on communication strategies to improve these outcomes.";0
Expert consensus on re-irradiation for recurrent glioma.;PURPOSE: To investigate radiation oncologists' opinions on important considerations to offering re-irradiation (re-RT) as a treatment option for recurrent glioma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was conducted with 13 radiation oncologists involved in the care of central nervous system tumor patients. The survey was comprised of 49 questions divided into 2 domains: a demographic section (10 questions) and a case section (5 re-RT cases with 5 to 6 questions representing one or several re-RT treatment dilemmas as may be encountered in the clinic). Respondents were asked to rate the relevance of various factors to offering re-RT, respond to the cases with a decision to offer re-RT vs. not, volume to be treated, margins to be employed, dose/fractionation suggested and any additional comments with respect to rationale in each scenario. RESULTS: Sixty nine percent of responders have been practicing for greater than 10 years and 61% have re-RT 20 to 100 patients to date, with 54% seeing 2-5 re-RT cases per month and retreating 1-2 patients per month. Recurrent tumor volume, time since previous radiation therapy, previously administered dose to organs at risk and patient performance status were rated by the majority of responders (85%, 92%, 77%, and 69% respectively) as extremely relevant or very relevant to offering re-RT as an option. CONCLUSION: The experts' practice of re-RT is still heterogeneous, reflecting the paucity of high-quality prospective data available for decision-making. Nevertheless, practicing radiation oncologists can support own decisions by referring to the cases found suitable for re-RT in this survey.;0
A failure-type specific risk prediction tool for selection of head-and-neck cancer patients for experimental treatments.;OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work was to develop a tool for decision support, providing simultaneous predictions of the risk of loco-regional failure (LRF) and distant metastasis (DM) after definitive treatment for head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective data for 560HNSCC patients were used to generate a multi-endpoint model, combining three cause-specific Cox models (LRF, DM and death with no evidence of disease (death NED)). The model was used to generate risk profiles of patients eligible for/included in a de-intensification study (RTOG 1016) and a dose escalation study (CONTRAST), respectively, to illustrate model predictions versus classic inclusion/exclusion criteria for clinical trials. The model is published as an on-line interactive tool (https://katrin.shinyapps.io/HNSCCmodel/). RESULTS: The final model included pre-selected clinical variables (tumor subsite, T stage, N stage, smoking status, age and performance status) and one additional variable (tumor volume). The treatment failure discrimination ability of the developed model was superior of that of UICC staging, 8(th) edition (AUC(LRF)=72.7% vs 64.2%, p<0.001 and AUC(DM)=70.7% vs 58.8%, p<0.001). Using the model for trial inclusion simulation, it was found that 14% of patients eligible for the de-intensification study had>20% risk of tumor relapse. Conversely, 9 of the 15 dose escalation trial participants had LRF risks<20%. CONCLUSION: A multi-endpoint model was generated and published as an on-line interactive tool. Its potential in decision support was illustrated by generating risk profiles for patients eligible for/included in clinical trials for HNSCC.;0
Deep reinforcement learning for automated radiation adaptation in lung cancer.;"PURPOSE: To investigate deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based on historical treatment plans for developing automated radiation adaptation protocols for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients that aim to maximize tumor local control at reduced rates of radiation pneumonitis grade 2 (RP2). METHODS: In a retrospective population of 114 NSCLC patients who received radiotherapy, a three-component neural networks framework was developed for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) of dose fractionation adaptation. Large-scale patient characteristics included clinical, genetic, and imaging radiomics features in addition to tumor and lung dosimetric variables. First, a generative adversarial network (GAN) was employed to learn patient population characteristics necessary for DRL training from a relatively limited sample size. Second, a radiotherapy artificial environment (RAE) was reconstructed by a deep neural network (DNN) utilizing both original and synthetic data (by GAN) to estimate the transition probabilities for adaptation of personalized radiotherapy patients' treatment courses. Third, a deep Q-network (DQN) was applied to the RAE for choosing the optimal dose in a response-adapted treatment setting. This multicomponent reinforcement learning approach was benchmarked against real clinical decisions that were applied in an adaptive dose escalation clinical protocol. In which, 34 patients were treated based on avid PET signal in the tumor and constrained by a 17.2% normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) limit for RP2. The uncomplicated cure probability (P+) was used as a baseline reward function in the DRL. RESULTS: Taking our adaptive dose escalation protocol as a blueprint for the proposed DRL (GAN + RAE + DQN) architecture, we obtained an automated dose adaptation estimate for use at  approximately 2/3 of the way into the radiotherapy treatment course. By letting the DQN component freely control the estimated adaptive dose per fraction (ranging from 1-5 Gy), the DRL automatically favored dose escalation/de-escalation between 1.5 and 3.8 Gy, a range similar to that used in the clinical protocol. The same DQN yielded two patterns of dose escalation for the 34 test patients, but with different reward variants. First, using the baseline P+ reward function, individual adaptive fraction doses of the DQN had similar tendencies to the clinical data with an RMSE = 0.76 Gy; but adaptations suggested by the DQN were generally lower in magnitude (less aggressive). Second, by adjusting the P+ reward function with higher emphasis on mitigating local failure, better matching of doses between the DQN and the clinical protocol was achieved with an RMSE = 0.5 Gy. Moreover, the decisions selected by the DQN seemed to have better concordance with patients eventual outcomes. In comparison, the traditional temporal difference (TD) algorithm for reinforcement learning yielded an RMSE = 3.3 Gy due to numerical instabilities and lack of sufficient learning. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that automated dose adaptation by DRL is a feasible and a promising approach for achieving similar results to those chosen by clinicians. The process may require customization of the reward function if individual cases were to be considered. However, development of this framework into a fully credible autonomous system for clinical decision support would require further validation on larger multi-institutional datasets.";0
Radiomics: the bridge between medical imaging and personalized medicine.;Radiomics, the high-throughput mining of quantitative image features from standard-of-care medical imaging that enables data to be extracted and applied within clinical-decision support systems to improve diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive accuracy, is gaining importance in cancer research. Radiomic analysis exploits sophisticated image analysis tools and the rapid development and validation of medical imaging data that uses image-based signatures for precision diagnosis and treatment, providing a powerful tool in modern medicine. Herein, we describe the process of radiomics, its pitfalls, challenges, opportunities, and its capacity to improve clinical decision making, emphasizing the utility for patients with cancer. Currently, the field of radiomics lacks standardized evaluation of both the scientific integrity and the clinical relevance of the numerous published radiomics investigations resulting from the rapid growth of this area. Rigorous evaluation criteria and reporting guidelines need to be established in order for radiomics to mature as a discipline. Herein, we provide guidance for investigations to meet this urgent need in the field of radiomics.;0
The effect of information about the benefits and harms of mammography on women's decision-making: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.;"BACKGROUND: The decision to participate or not in breast cancer screening is complex due to the trade-off between the expected benefit of breast cancer mortality reduction and the major harm of overdiagnosis. It seems ethically necessary to inform women so that they can actively participate in decision-making and make an informed choice based on their values and preferences. The objective of this study is to assess the effects of receiving information about the benefits and harms of screening on decision-making, in women approaching the age of invitation to mammography screening. METHODS: A two-stage, randomized controlled trial (RCT). In the first stage, 40 Basic Health Areas (BHAs) will be selected and randomized to intervention or control. In the second stage, women within each BHA will be randomly selected (n = 400). Four breast cancer screening programs (BCSPs) of the Spanish public health system, three in Catalonia and one in the Canary Islands will participate in the study. Women in the intervention arm will receive a leaflet with detailed information on the benefits and harms of screening using mammography. Women in the control arm will receive a standard leaflet that does not mention harms and recommends accepting the invitation to participate in the biennial examinations of the BCSP. The primary outcome is informed choice, a dichotomous variable that combines knowledge, attitudes, and intentions. Secondary outcomes include decisional conflict; confidence in the decision made; anxiety about screening participation; worry about breast cancer; anticipated regret; time perspective; perceived importance of benefits/harms of screening; perceived risk of breast cancer; and leaflet acceptability. Primary and secondary outcomes are assessed 2-3 weeks after the intervention. DISCUSSION: This is the first RCT that assesses the effect of informing about the benefits and harms of breast cancer screening in Spain in women facing the decision to be screened using mammography. It aims to assess the impact of information on several decisional outcomes and to contribute to paving the road towards shared decision-making in breast cancer screening in our country.

Dynamic Risk Stratification in Stage I Papillary Thyroid Cancer Patients Younger Than 45 Years of Age.;BACKGROUND: This study validated the dynamic risk stratification (DRS) system with regard to its association with structural recurrence and risk factors associated with non-excellent responses in patients <45 years with stage I classical papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). METHODS: This historical cohort study included 598 patients with stage I classical PTC <45 years of age treated with total thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine remnant ablation (n = 440), total thyroidectomy without radioactive iodine remnant ablation (n = 23), and thyroid lobectomy alone (n = 135). RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 123 months. Structural recurrence occurred in 4.2% (n = 18/432) of the patients with an excellent response, 17.1% (18/105) of patients with an indeterminate response, 44.7% (17/38) of patients with a biochemically incomplete response, and 82.6% (19/23) of patients with a structurally incomplete response (p < 0.001) during the follow-up. The disease-free survival curves of each response showed significant differences (p < 0.001). Extensive extrathyroidal extension and extranodal extension were the independent risk factors associated with non-excellent response (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: DRS may reduce unnecessary additional treatments by reclassifying initial risk estimates of structural recurrence. Furthermore, applying the risk factors associated with non-excellent response to initial therapy may be a more useful and viable surrogate of the risk for structural recurrence in stage I PTC patients <45 years of age.;0
Pharmacometabolomics Informs Quantitative Radiomics for Glioblastoma Diagnostic Innovation.;"Applications of omics systems biology technologies have enormous promise for radiology and diagnostics in surgical fields. In this context, the emerging fields of radiomics (a systems scale approach to radiology using a host of technologies, including omics) and pharmacometabolomics (use of metabolomics for patient and disease stratification and guiding precision medicine) offer much synergy for diagnostic innovation in surgery, particularly in neurosurgery. This synthesis of omics fields and applications is timely because diagnostic accuracy in central nervous system tumors still challenges decision-making. Considering the vast heterogeneity in brain tumors, disease phenotypes, and interindividual variability in surgical and chemotherapy outcomes, we believe that diagnostic accuracy can be markedly improved by quantitative radiomics coupled to pharmacometabolomics and related health information technologies while optimizing economic costs of traditional diagnostics. In this expert review, we present an innovation analysis on a systems-level multi-omics approach toward diagnostic accuracy in central nervous system tumors. For this, we suggest that glioblastomas serve as a useful application paradigm. We performed a literature search on PubMed for articles published in English between 2006 and 2016. We used the search terms ""radiomics,"" ""glioblastoma,"" ""biomarkers,"" ""pharmacogenomics,"" ""pharmacometabolomics,"" ""pharmacometabonomics/pharmacometabolomics,"" ""collaborative informatics,"" and ""precision medicine."" A list of the top 4 insights we derived from this literature analysis is presented in this study. For example, we found that (i) tumor grading needs to be better refined, (ii) diagnostic precision should be improved, (iii) standardization in radiomics is lacking, and (iv) quantitative radiomics needs to prove clinical implementation. We conclude with an interdisciplinary call to the metabolomics, pharmacy/pharmacology, radiology, and surgery communities that pharmacometabolomics coupled to information technologies (chemoinformatics tools, databases, collaborative systems) can inform quantitative radiomics, thus translating Big Data and information growth to knowledge growth, rational drug development and diagnostics innovation for glioblastomas, and possibly in other brain tumors.";0
Clinical Usefulness of Tools to Support Decision-making for Palliative Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: A Systematic Review.;"BACKGROUND: Decision-making regarding palliative treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is complex and comprises numerous decisions. Decision-making should be guided by the premise of maintaining and/or improving patients' quality of life, by patient preference, and by the trade-off between treatment benefits and harm. Decision support systems (DSSs) for clinicians (eg, nomograms) can assist in this process. The present systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the available DSSs for incurable mCRC and to assess their clinical usefulness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. We extracted information on the DSS characteristics and their discriminatory ability, calibration, and user-friendliness. RESULTS: From 5205 studies, we identified 14 DSSs for decisions regarding palliative resection of the primary tumor (n = 3), radiotherapy for metastases (n = 2), treatment type (invasive vs. symptomatic only; n = 7), and selection of chemotherapy (n = 2). The predictors varied greatly among the DSSs, and only 1 DSS incorporated a genetic marker (ie, UGT1A1). None of the DSSs included > 1 treatment option, nor did any DSS present estimates of treatment benefits and harms. Five tools had not been externally validated, two had only been validated in < 35 patients, and the rest had only been validated in populations similar to the population used for their development. Discriminatory accuracy was generally moderate to poor. Calibration measures were only reported for 2 tools. CONCLUSION: A limited number of DSSs are available to support palliative treatment decisions for patients with mCRC, and the evidence regarding their discriminatory ability and calibration is too limited to recommend their use. New DSSs comparing multiple treatment options and presenting both treatment benefits and harms are needed.";0
Defining the biological basis of radiomic phenotypes in lung cancer.;"Medical imaging can visualize characteristics of human cancer noninvasively. Radiomics is an emerging field that translates these medical images into quantitative data to enable phenotypic profiling of tumors. While radiomics has been associated with several clinical endpoints, the complex relationships of radiomics, clinical factors, and tumor biology are largely unknown. To this end, we analyzed two independent cohorts of respectively 262 North American and 89 European patients with lung cancer, and consistently identified previously undescribed associations between radiomic imaging features, molecular pathways, and clinical factors. In particular, we found a relationship between imaging features, immune response, inflammation, and survival, which was further validated by immunohistochemical staining. Moreover, a number of imaging features showed predictive value for specific pathways; for example, intra-tumor heterogeneity features predicted activity of RNA polymerase transcription (AUC = 0.62, p=0.03) and intensity dispersion was predictive of the autodegration pathway of a ubiquitin ligase (AUC = 0.69, p<10(-4)). Finally, we observed that prognostic biomarkers performed highest when combining radiomic, genetic, and clinical information (CI = 0.73, p<10(-9)) indicating complementary value of these data. In conclusion, we demonstrate that radiomic approaches permit noninvasive assessment of both molecular and clinical characteristics of tumors, and therefore have the potential to advance clinical decision-making by systematically analyzing standard-of-care medical images.";0
Chronic Disease Registries - Trends and Challenges.;"BACKGROUND: This accompanying editorial is an introduction to the focus theme of ""chronic disease registries - trends and challenges"". METHODS: A call for papers was announced on the website of Methods of Information in Medicine in April 2016 with submission deadline in September 2016. A peer review process was established to select the papers for the focus theme, managed by two guest editors. RESULTS: Three papers were selected to be included in the focus theme. Topics range from contributions to patient care through implementation of clinical decision support functionality in clinical registries; analysing similar-purposed acute coronary syndrome registries of two countries and their registry-to-SNOMED CT maps; and data extraction for speciality population registries from electronic health record data rather than manual abstraction. CONCLUSIONS: The focus theme gives insight into new developments related to disease registration. This applies to technical challenges such as data linkage and data as well as data structure abstraction, but also the utilisation for clinical decision making.";0
An Environment for Guideline-based Decision Support Systems for Outpatients Monitoring.;"OBJECTIVES: We propose an architecture for monitoring outpatients that relies on mobile technologies for acquiring data. The goal is to better control the onset of possible side effects between the scheduled visits at the clinic. METHODS: We analyze the architectural components required to ensure a high level of abstraction from data. Clinical practice guidelines were formalized with Alium, an authoring tool based on the PROforma language, using SNOMED-CT as a terminology standard. The Alium engine is accessible through a set of APIs that may be leveraged for implementing an application based on standard web technologies to be used by doctors at the clinic. Data sent by patients using mobile devices need to be complemented with those already available in the Electronic Health Record to generate personalized recommendations. Thus a middleware pursuing data abstraction is required. To comply with current standards, we adopted the HL7 Virtual Medical Record for Clinical Decision Support Logical Model, Release 2. RESULTS: The developed architecture for monitoring outpatients includes: (1) a guideline-based Decision Support System accessible through a web application that helps the doctors with prevention, diagnosis and treatment of therapy side effects; (2) an application for mobile devices, which allows patients to regularly send data to the clinic. In order to tailor the monitoring procedures to the specific patient, the Decision Support System also helps physicians with the configuration of the mobile application, suggesting the data to be collected and the associated collection frequency that may change over time, according to the individual patient's conditions. A proof of concept has been developed with a system for monitoring the side effects of chemo-radiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our environment introduces two main innovation elements with respect to similar works available in the literature. First, in order to meet the specific patients' needs, in our work the Decision Support System also helps the physicians in properly configuring the mobile application. Then the Decision Support System is also continuously fed by patient-reported outcomes.";0
A Bayesian network and heuristic approach for systematic characterization of radiotherapy receipt after breast-conservation surgery.;BACKGROUND: Breast-conservation surgery with radiotherapy is a treatment highly recommended by the guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. However, several variables influence the final receipt of radiotherapy and it might not be administered to breast cancer patients. Our objective is to propose a systematic framework to identify the clinical and non-clinical variables that influence the receipt of unexpected radiotherapy treatment by means of Bayesian networks and a proposed heuristic approach. METHODS: We used cancer registry data of Detroit, San Francisco-Oakland, and Atlanta from years 2007-2012 downloaded from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. The samples had patients diagnosed with in situ and early invasive cancer with 14 clinical and non-clinical variables. Bayesian networks were fitted to the data of each region and systematically analyzed through the proposed Zoom-in heuristic. A comparative analysis with logistic regressions is also presented. RESULTS: For Detroit, patients under stage 0, grade undetermined, histology lobular carcinoma in situ, and age between 26-50 were found more likely to receive breast-conservation surgery without radiotherapy. For stages I, IIA, and IIB patients with age between 51-75, and grade II were found to be more likely to receive breast-conservation surgery with radiotherapy. For San Francisco-Oakland, patients under stage 0, grade undetermined, and age >75 are more likely to receive BCS. For stages I, IIA, and IIB patients with age >75 are more likely to receive breast-conservation surgery without radiotherapy. For Atlanta, patients under stage 0, grade undetermined, year 2011, and primary site C509 are more likely to receive breast-conservation surgery without radiotherapy. For stages I, IIA, and IIB patients in year 2011, and grade III are more likely to receive breast-conservation surgery without radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: For in situ breast cancer and early invasive breast cancer, the results are in accordance with the guidelines and very well demonstrates the usefulness of the Zoom-in heuristic in systematically characterizing a group receiving a treatment. We found a subset of the population from Detroit with ductal carcinoma in situ for which breast-conservation surgery without radiotherapy was received, but potential reasons for this treatment are still unknown.;0
Management of Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer: The Report of the Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference APCCC 2017.;"BACKGROUND: In advanced prostate cancer (APC), successful drug development as well as advances in imaging and molecular characterisation have resulted in multiple areas where there is lack of evidence or low level of evidence. The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) 2017 addressed some of these topics. OBJECTIVE: To present the report of APCCC 2017. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Ten important areas of controversy in APC management were identified: high-risk localised and locally advanced prostate cancer; ""oligometastatic"" prostate cancer; castration-naive and castration-resistant prostate cancer; the role of imaging in APC; osteoclast-targeted therapy; molecular characterisation of blood and tissue; genetic counselling/testing; side effects of systemic treatment(s); global access to prostate cancer drugs. A panel of 60 international prostate cancer experts developed the program and the consensus questions. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The panel voted publicly but anonymously on 150 predefined questions, which have been developed following a modified Delphi process. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Voting is based on panellist opinion, and thus is not based on a standard literature review or meta-analysis. The outcomes of the voting had varying degrees of support, as reflected in the wording of this article, as well as in the detailed voting results recorded in Supplementary data. CONCLUSIONS: The presented expert voting results can be used for support in areas of management of men with APC where there is no high-level evidence, but individualised treatment decisions should as always be based on all of the data available, including disease extent and location, prior therapies regardless of type, host factors including comorbidities, as well as patient preferences, current and emerging evidence, and logistical and economic constraints. Inclusion of men with APC in clinical trials should be strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2017 again identified important areas in need of trials specifically designed to address them. PATIENT SUMMARY: The second Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference APCCC 2017 did provide a forum for discussion and debates on current treatment options for men with advanced prostate cancer. The aim of the conference is to bring the expertise of world experts to care givers around the world who see less patients with prostate cancer. The conference concluded with a discussion and voting of the expert panel on predefined consensus questions, targeting areas of primary clinical relevance. The results of these expert opinion votes are embedded in the clinical context of current treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer and provide a practical guide to clinicians to assist in the discussions with men with prostate cancer as part of a shared and multidisciplinary decision-making process.";0
Changes at the Dinner Table and Beyond: Nourishing Our Patients Throughout the Trajectory of Their Cancer Journey.;Patients with head and neck cancers (HNC) can experience significant distress from presentation of symptoms to surveillance/survivorship and end-of-life. It is of value to all members of the HNC team to practice patient-centered care in assessment and interventions with patients and their support systems to achieve the best possible outcome given patient health status. Early assessment and referral to ancillary support provide a strong foundation across the illness trajectory. Specific attention should be given to the psychosocial implications of changes in physiologic functioning. Support around these changes involves a strong multidisciplinary team familiar with the biopsychosocial effects of HNC and its treatment.;0
Quality and impact of eviQ Cancer Treatments Online (www.eviq.org.au): the medical oncologist's perspective.;INTRODUCTION: eviQ Cancer Treatments Online is a free, web-based resource providing access to over 600 evidence-based treatment protocols in medical oncology, radiation oncology, hematology and cancer genetics. With over 60 000 registrants from 148 countries, eviQ is widely used by cancer clinicians globally. The aim of this study was to examine the perceived quality of eviQ by Australian medical oncologists, the impact it had on their knowledge and practice, and the effect it had on their patients. METHODS: A web-based survey was administered to members of the Medical Oncology Group of Australia by email. Two reminders emails were sent to encourage participation. RESULTS: Of the 97 respondents (15%), all but one, were practicing in Australia, with varying years of oncology experience (<2 years: 25%, 2-10 years: 36%, >10 years: 39%). eviQ was most frequently used as a source for providing patient information sheets on chemotherapy side effects, with 57% of respondents using eviQ for this purpose. Other uses included accessing side effect information (27%), checking drug doses (26%) and guiding dose adjustments (22%). The majority of respondents rated eviQ as current, accurate and relevant with over 90% agreeing that eviQ was of a high quality. Most of the respondents reported that they provided better care with enhanced patient experiences as a result of using eviQ. CONCLUSIONS: eviQ was highly regarded by Australian medical oncologists who responded to our survey. The results suggested that usage of eviQ had a positive impact on individual knowledge, practice and promoted better patient-centered care.;0
Development of a fast Monte Carlo dose calculation system for online adaptive radiation therapy quality assurance.;Online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) based on real-time magnetic resonance imaging represents a paradigm-changing treatment scheme. However, conventional quality assurance (QA) methods based on phantom measurements are not feasible with the patient on the treatment couch. The purpose of this work is to develop a fast Monte Carlo system for validating online re-optimized tri-60Co IMRT adaptive plans with both high accuracy and speed. The Monte Carlo system is based on dose planning method (DPM) code with further simplification of electron transport and consideration of external magnetic fields. A vendor-provided head model was incorporated into the code. Both GPU acceleration and variance reduction were implemented. Additionally, to facilitate real-time decision support, a C++ GUI was developed for visualizing 3D dose distributions and performing various analyses in an online adaptive setting. A thoroughly validated Monte Carlo code (gPENELOPE) was used to benchmark the new system, named GPU-accelerated DPM with variance reduction (gDPMvr). The comparison using 15 clinical IMRT plans demonstrated that gDPMvr typically runs 43 times faster with only 0.5% loss in accuracy. Moreover, gDPMvr reached 1% local dose uncertainty within 2.3 min on average, and thus is well-suited for ART QA.;0
The role of tumor board conferences in neuro-oncology: a nationwide provider survey.;"The tumor board or multidisciplinary cancer meeting (MCM) is the foundation of high value multidisciplinary oncology care, coordinating teams of specialists. Little is known on how these meetings are implemented in Neuro-oncology. Benefits of MCMs include coordination, direction for complicated cases, education, and a forum for communication, emerging technology, and clinical trials. This study identifies participation and utilization of neuro-oncology MCMs. A cross-sectional descriptive survey was dispersed through an internet questionnaire. The Society of Neuro-Oncology and the American Brain Tumor Association provided a list of dedicated neuro-oncology centers. All National Cancer Institute designated centers, and participants in the Adult Brain Tumor Consortium or the Brain Tumor Trials Collaborative were included, identifying 85 centers. Discussion included primary brain tumors (100%), challenging cases (98%), recurrent disease (96%), neoplastic spine disease (93%), metastatic brain lesions (89%), pre-surgical cases (82%), pathology (76%), and paraneoplastic disease (40%). MCMs were composed of neuro-oncologists, neurosurgeons, and radiation oncologists (100%), radiologists (98%), pathologists (96%), and clinical trial participants (64%). Individual preparation ranged from 15 to 300 min. MCMs were valued for clinical decision making (94%), education (89%), and access to clinical trials (69%). 13% documented MCMs in the medical record. 38% of centers used a molecular tumor board; however, many commented with uncertainty as to how this is defined. Neuro-oncology MCMs at leading U.S. institutions demonstrate congruity of core disciplines, cases discussed, and perceived value. We identified variability in preparation time and implementation of MCM recommendations. There is high uncertainty as to the definition and application of a molecular tumor board.";0
Association Between Radiation Therapy, Surgery, or Observation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Patient-Reported Outcomes After 3 Years.;"IMPORTANCE: Understanding the adverse effects of contemporary approaches to localized prostate cancer treatment could inform shared decision making. OBJECTIVE: To compare functional outcomes and adverse effects associated with radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and active surveillance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective, population-based, cohort study involving 2550 men (</=80 years) diagnosed in 2011-2012 with clinical stage cT1-2, localized prostate cancer, with prostate-specific antigen levels less than 50 ng/mL, and enrolled within 6 months of diagnosis. EXPOSURES: Treatment with radical prostatectomy, EBRT, or active surveillance was ascertained within 1 year of diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient-reported function on the 26-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) 36 months after enrollment. Higher domain scores (range, 0-100) indicate better function. Minimum clinically important difference was defined as 10 to 12 points for sexual function, 6 for urinary incontinence, 5 for urinary irritative symptoms, 5 for bowel function, and 4 for hormonal function. RESULTS: The cohort included 2550 men (mean age, 63.8 years; 74% white, 55% had intermediate- or high-risk disease), of whom 1523 (59.7%) underwent radical prostatectomy, 598 (23.5%) EBRT, and 429 (16.8%) active surveillance. Men in the EBRT group were older (mean age, 68.1 years vs 61.5 years, P < .001) and had worse baseline sexual function (mean score, 52.3 vs 65.2, P < .001) than men in the radical prostatectomy group. At 3 years, the adjusted mean sexual domain score for radical prostatectomy decreased more than for EBRT (mean difference, -11.9 points; 95% CI, -15.1 to -8.7). The decline in sexual domain scores between EBRT and active surveillance was not clinically significant (-4.3 points; 95% CI, -9.2 to 0.7). Radical prostatectomy was associated with worse urinary incontinence than EBRT (-18.0 points; 95% CI, -20.5 to -15.4) and active surveillance (-12.7 points; 95% CI, -16.0 to -9.3) but was associated with better urinary irritative symptoms than active surveillance (5.2 points; 95% CI, 3.2 to 7.2). No clinically significant differences for bowel or hormone function were noted beyond 12 months. No differences in health-related quality of life or disease-specific survival (3 deaths) were noted (99.7%-100%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort of men with localized prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy was associated with a greater decrease in sexual function and urinary incontinence than either EBRT or active surveillance after 3 years and was associated with fewer urinary irritative symptoms than active surveillance; however, no meaningful differences existed in either bowel or hormonal function beyond 12 months or in in other domains of health-related quality-of-life measures. These findings may facilitate counseling regarding the comparative harms of contemporary treatments for prostate cancer.";0
Rationale and Design of a Phase 1 Clinical Trial to Evaluate HSV G207 Alone or with a Single Radiation Dose in Children with Progressive or Recurrent Malignant Supratentorial Brain Tumors.;Primary central nervous system tumors are the most common solid neoplasm of childhood and the leading cause of cancer-related death in pediatric patients. Survival rates for children with malignant supratentorial brain tumors are poor despite aggressive treatment with combinations of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, and survivors often suffer from damaging lifelong sequelae from current therapies. Novel innovative treatments are greatly needed. One promising new approach is the use of a genetically engineered, conditionally replicating herpes simplex virus (HSV) that has shown tumor-specific tropism and potential efficacy in the treatment of malignant brain tumors. G207 is a genetically engineered HSV-1 lacking genes essential for replication in normal brain cells. Safety has been established in preclinical investigations involving intracranial inoculation in the highly HSV-sensitive owl monkey (Aotus nancymai), and in three adult phase 1 trials in recurrent/progressive high-grade gliomas. No dose-limiting toxicities were seen in the adult studies and a maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Approximately half of the 35 treated adults had radiographic or neuropathologic evidence of response at a minimum of one time point. Preclinical studies in pediatric brain tumor models indicate that a variety of pediatric tumor types are highly sensitive to killing by G207. This clinical protocol outlines a first in human children study of intratumoral inoculation of an oncolytic virus via catheters placed directly into recurrent or progressive supratentorial malignant tumors.;0
Vector-model-supported approach in prostate plan optimization.;Lengthy time consumed in traditional manual plan optimization can limit the use of step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiotherapy/volumetric-modulated radiotherapy (S&S IMRT/VMAT). A vector model base, retrieving similar radiotherapy cases, was developed with respect to the structural and physiologic features extracted from the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files. Planning parameters were retrieved from the selected similar reference case and applied to the test case to bypass the gradual adjustment of planning parameters. Therefore, the planning time spent on the traditional trial-and-error manual optimization approach in the beginning of optimization could be reduced. Each S&S IMRT/VMAT prostate reference database comprised 100 previously treated cases. Prostate cases were replanned with both traditional optimization and vector-model-supported optimization based on the oncologists' clinical dose prescriptions. A total of 360 plans, which consisted of 30 cases of S&S IMRT, 30 cases of 1-arc VMAT, and 30 cases of 2-arc VMAT plans including first optimization and final optimization with/without vector-model-supported optimization, were compared using the 2-sided t-test and paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, with a significance level of 0.05 and a false discovery rate of less than 0.05. For S&S IMRT, 1-arc VMAT, and 2-arc VMAT prostate plans, there was a significant reduction in the planning time and iteration with vector-model-supported optimization by almost 50%. When the first optimization plans were compared, 2-arc VMAT prostate plans had better plan quality than 1-arc VMAT plans. The volume receiving 35 Gy in the femoral head for 2-arc VMAT plans was reduced with the vector-model-supported optimization compared with the traditional manual optimization approach. Otherwise, the quality of plans from both approaches was comparable. Vector-model-supported optimization was shown to offer much shortened planning time and iteration number without compromising the plan quality.;0
Vector-model-supported optimization in volumetric-modulated arc stereotactic radiotherapy planning for brain metastasis.;"Long planning time in volumetric-modulated arc stereotactic radiotherapy (VMA-SRT) cases can limit its clinical efficiency and use. A vector model could retrieve previously successful radiotherapy cases that share various common anatomic features with the current case. The prsent study aimed to develop a vector model that could reduce planning time by applying the optimization parameters from those retrieved reference cases. Thirty-six VMA-SRT cases of brain metastasis (gender, male [n = 23], female [n = 13]; age range, 32 to 81 years old) were collected and used as a reference database. Another 10 VMA-SRT cases were planned with both conventional optimization and vector-model-supported optimization, following the oncologists' clinical dose prescriptions. Planning time and plan quality measures were compared using the 2-sided paired Wilcoxon signed rank test with a significance level of 0.05, with positive false discovery rate (pFDR) of less than 0.05. With vector-model-supported optimization, there was a significant reduction in the median planning time, a 40% reduction from 3.7 to 2.2 hours (p = 0.002, pFDR = 0.032), and for the number of iterations, a 30% reduction from 8.5 to 6.0 (p = 0.006, pFDR = 0.047). The quality of plans from both approaches was comparable. From these preliminary results, vector-model-supported optimization can expedite the optimization of VMA-SRT for brain metastasis while maintaining plan quality.";0
Expert system classifier for adaptive radiation therapy in prostate cancer.;A classifier-based expert system was developed to compare delivered and planned radiation therapy in prostate cancer patients. Its aim is to automatically identify patients that can benefit from an adaptive treatment strategy. The study predominantly addresses dosimetric uncertainties and critical issues caused by motion of hollow organs. 1200 MVCT images of 38 prostate adenocarcinoma cases were analyzed. An automatic daily re-contouring of structures (i.e. rectum, bladder and femoral heads), rigid/deformable registration and dose warping was carried out to simulate dose and volume variations during therapy. Support vector machine, K-means clustering algorithms and similarity index analysis were used to create an unsupervised predictive tool to detect incorrect setup and/or morphological changes as a consequence of inadequate patient preparation due to stochastic physiological changes, supporting clinical decision-making. After training on a dataset that was considered sufficiently dosimetrically stable, the system identified two equally sized macro clusters with distinctly different volumetric and dosimetric baseline properties and defined thresholds for these two clusters. Application to the test cohort resulted in 25% of the patients located outside the two macro clusters thresholds and which were therefore suspected to be dosimetrically unstable. In these patients, over the treatment course, mean volumetric changes of 30 and 40% for rectum and bladder were detected which possibly represents values justifying adjustment of patient preparation, frequent re-planning or a plan-of-the-day strategy. Based on our research, by combining daily IGRT images with rigid/deformable registration and dose warping, it is possible to apply a machine learning approach to the clinical setting obtaining useful information for a decision regarding an individualized adaptive strategy. Especially for treatments influenced by the movement of hollow organs, this could reduce inadequate treatments and possibly reduce toxicity, thereby increasing overall RT efficacy.;0
Reduced patient anxiety as a result of radiation therapist-led psychosocial support: a systematic review.;Up to 49% of patients attending radiation therapy appointments may experience anxiety and distress. Anxiety is heightened during the first few visits to radiation oncology. Radiation therapists (RT) are the only health professionals in direct daily contact with patients during treatment, placing them in a unique position to explore patients' psychosocial needs. This review aims to synthesise literature regarding the effect of RT-led psychosocial support on patient anxiety. In May 2015, we searched the following electronic databases: Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, PubMed and Cochrane library. Radiation therapy-specific journals were hand-searched, and reference lists of identified studies searched. This review complies with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The search identified 263 articles, of which 251 were excluded based on non-English language, duplicate article or relevance. A total of 12 articles involving 1363 patients were included and categorised into three broad themes: 'Patient Perspectives' 3 articles, 'Patient Information and Education' 5 articles and 'Screening and Needs Assessment' 4 articles. Two publications referred to the same sample and data. Quality ratings were mixed, with one study rated 'high' quality, seven 'moderate' and four 'low'. Methodological weaknesses were identified in relation to workflow, sample size and responder bias. RTs have a role in psychosocial support through increased communication and information sharing, which can benefit both patients and staff. RT-led practices such as relationship building, patient education sessions and screening and needs assessments are feasible and can reduce anxiety.;0
Improving Oncology Quality Measurement in Accountable Care: Filling Gaps with Cross-Cutting Measures.;"Payment for health care services, including oncology services, is shifting from volume-based fee-for-service to value-based accountable care. The objective of accountable care is to support providers with flexibility and resources to reform care delivery, accompanied by accountability for maintaining or improving outcomes while lowering costs. These changes depend on health care payers, systems, physicians, and patients having meaningful measures to assess care delivery and outcomes and to balance financial incentives for lowering costs while providing greater value. Gaps in accountable care measure sets may cause missed signals of problems in care and missed opportunities for improvement. Measures to balance financial incentives may be particularly important for oncology, where high cost and increasingly targeted diagnostics and therapeutics intersect with the highly complex and heterogeneous needs and preferences of cancer patients. Moreover, the concept of value in cancer care, defined as the measure of outcomes achieved per costs incurred, is rarely incorporated into performance measurement. This article analyzes gaps in oncology measures in accountable care, discusses challenging measurement issues, and offers strategies for improving oncology measurement. Discern Health analyzed gaps in accountable care measure sets for 10 cancer conditions that were selected based on incidence and prevalence; impact on cost and mortality; a diverse range of high-cost diagnostic procedures and treatment modalities (e.g., genomic tumor testing, molecularly targeted therapies, and stereotactic radiotherapy); and disparities or performance gaps in patient care. We identified gaps by comparing accountable care set measures with high-priority measurement opportunities derived from practice guidelines developed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and other oncology specialty societies. We found significant gaps in accountable care measure sets across all 10 conditions. For each gap, we searched for available measures not already being used in programs. Where existing measures did not cover gaps, we recommended refinements to existing measures or proposed measures for development. We shared the results of the measure gap analysis with a roundtable of national experts in cancer care and oncology measurement. During a web meeting and an in-person meeting, the roundtable reviewed the gap analysis and identified priority opportunities for improving measurement. The group determined that overreliance on condition-specific process measures is problematic because of rapidly changing evidence and increasing personalization of cancer care. The group's primary recommendation for enhancing measure sets was to prioritize and develop effective cross-cutting measures that assess clinical and patient-reported outcomes, including shared decision making, care planning, and symptom control. The group also prioritized certain safety and structural measures to complement condition-specific process measures. Further, the group explored strategies for using clinical pathways and devising layered measurement approaches to improve measurement for accountable care. This article presents the roundtable's conclusions and recommendations for next steps. DISCLOSURES: Funding for this project was provided by the National Pharmaceutical Council (NPC).

Development and external validation of a nomogram and online tool to predict bowel dysfunction following restorative rectal cancer resection: the POLARS score.;"OBJECTIVE: Bowel dysfunction is common following a restorative rectal cancer resection, but symptom severity and the degree of quality of life impairment is highly variable. An internationally validated patient-reported outcome measure, Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) score, now enables these symptoms to be measured. The study purpose was: (1) to develop a model that predicts postoperative bowel function; (2) externally validate the model and (3) incorporate these findings into a nomogram and online tool in order to individualise patient counselling and aid preoperative consent. DESIGN: Patients more than 1 year after curative restorative anterior resection (UK, median 54 months; Denmark (DK), 56 months since surgery) were invited to complete The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 version3 (EORTC QLQ-C30 v3), LARS and Wexner incontinence scores. Demographics, tumour characteristics, preoperative/postoperative treatment and surgical procedures were recorded. Using transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidelines, risk factors for bowel dysfunction were independently assessed by advanced linear regression shrinkage techniques for each dataset (UK:DK). RESULTS: Patients in the development (UK, n=463) and validation (DK, n=938) datasets reported mean (SD) LARS scores of 26 (11) and 24 (11), respectively. Key predictive factors for LARS were: age (at surgery); tumour height, total versus partial mesorectal excision, stoma and preoperative radiotherapy, with satisfactory model calibration and a Mallow's Cp of 7.5 and 5.5, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The Pre-Operative LARS score (POLARS) is the first nomogram and online tool to predict bowel dysfunction severity prior to anterior resection. Colorectal surgeons, gastroenterologist and nurse specialists may use POLARS to help patients understand their risk of bowel dysfunction and to preoperatively highlight patients who may require additional postoperative support.";0
Dumping the information bucket: A qualitative study of clinicians caring for patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer.;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of patient-clinician communication and shared decision making (SDM) when two disparate treatments for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are discussed. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study to evaluate the experiences of 20 clinicians caring for patients with clinical Stage I NSCLC prior to treatment, focusing on communication practices. We used directed content analysis and a patient-centered communication theoretical model to guide understanding of communication strategies. RESULTS: All clinicians expressed the importance of providing information, especially for mitigating patient worry, despite recognition that patients recall only a small amount of the information given. When patients expressed distress, clinicians exhibited empathy but preferred to provide more information in order to address patient concerns. Most clinicians reported practicing SDM, however, they also reported not clearly eliciting patient preferences and values, a key part of SDM. CONCLUSION: Communication with patients about treatment options for early stage NSCLC primary includes information giving. We found that only a few communication domains associated with SDM occurred regularly, and SDM may not be necessary in this clinical context. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians may need to incorporate nurse navigators or more written materials for effectively discussing potentially equivalent treatment options with their patients.;0
Second Opinions From Medical Oncologists for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Prevalence, Correlates, and Consequences.;"IMPORTANCE: Advances in the evaluation and treatment of breast cancer have made the clinical decision-making context much more complex. A second opinion from a medical oncologist may facilitate decision making for women with breast cancer, yet little is known about second opinion use. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the patterns and correlates of second opinion use and the effect on chemotherapy decisions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1901 women newly diagnosed with stages 0 to II breast cancer between July 2013 and September 2014 (response rate, 71.0%) were accrued through 2 population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries (Georgia and Los Angeles County, California) and surveyed about their experiences with medical oncologists, decision making, and chemotherapy use. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Factors associated with second opinion use were evaluated using logistic regression. Also assessed was the association between second opinion and chemotherapy use, adjusting for chemotherapy indication and propensity for receiving a second opinion. Multiple imputation and weighting were used to account for missing data. RESULTS: A total of 1901 patients with stage I to II breast cancer (mean [SD] age, 61.6 [11.0] years; 1071 [56.3%] non-Hispanic white) saw any medical oncologist. Analysis of multiply imputed, weighted data (mean n = 1866) showed that 168 (9.8%) (SE, 0.74%) received a second opinion and 54 (3.2%) (SE, 0.47%) received chemotherapy from the second oncologist. Satisfaction with chemotherapy decisions was high and did not differ between those who did (mean [SD], 4.3 [0.08] on a 1- to 5-point scale) or did not (4.4 [0.03]) obtain a second opinion (P = .29). Predictors of second opinion use included college education vs less education (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.24-2.75), frequent use of internet-based support groups (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.12-4.11), an intermediate result on the 21-gene recurrence score assay (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.11-3.09), and a variant of uncertain significance on hereditary cancer genetic testing (OR, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.09-9.59). After controlling for patient and tumor characteristics, second opinion use was not associated with chemotherapy receipt (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.71-1.52). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Second opinion use was low (<10%) among patients with early-stage breast cancer, and high decision satisfaction regardless of second opinion use suggests little unmet demand. Along with educational level and use of internet support groups, uncertain results on genomic testing predicted second opinion use. Patient demand for second opinions may increase as more complex genomic tests are disseminated.";0
COLLABORADI: a rule-based diagnostic imaging prescription system to help the general practitioner to choose the most appropriate radiological imaging procedures.;Significant advances in medical imaging have been made in the past decades, enabling physicians to reach high precision in diagnosing patients' diseases by means of sophisticated imaging tools. However, the use of sophisticated tools is limited by the high costs and, in some cases, by the utilization of ionizing radiation, which have both great impact on the economy of a nation and on citizens' health, respectively. Guidelines have been published among countries to provide physicians with structured rules to be followed to suggest the correct imaging technique, suiting better the diagnostic question and avoiding inappropriate imaging requests. The COLLABORADI is a research project that addressed the phenomenon of inappropriate imaging prescriptions in Sicily (Italy) and proposed the design and implementation of a clinical decision support system to help physicians to set up the most appropriate diagnostic route for their patients. The aim of this paper is to describe the characteristics of the COLLABORADI software and its potential impact in diminishing inappropriate imaging.;0
Avoiding Radical Surgery in Elderly Patients With Rectal Cancer Is Cost-Effective.;"BACKGROUND: Radical surgery is associated with significant perioperative mortality in elderly and comorbid populations. Emerging data suggest for patients with a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy that a watch-and-wait approach may provide equivalent survival and oncological outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of watch and wait and radical surgery for patients with rectal cancer after a clinical complete response following chemoradiotherapy. DESIGN: Decision analytical modeling and a Markov simulation were used to model long-term costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and cost-effectiveness after watch and wait and radical surgery. Sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the effect of uncertainty in model parameters. SETTINGS: A third-party payer perspective was adopted. PATIENTS: Patients included in the study were a 60-year-old male cohort with no comorbidities, 80-year-old male cohorts with no comorbidities, and 80-year-old male cohorts with significant comorbidities. INTERVENTIONS: Radical surgery and watch-and-wait approaches were studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness ratio over the entire lifetime of the hypothetical patient cohorts were measured. RESULTS: Watch and wait was more effective (60-year-old male cohort with no comorbidities = 0.63 quality-adjusted life-years (95% CI, 2.48-3.65 quality-adjusted life-years); 80-year-old male cohort with no comorbidities = 0.56 quality-adjusted life-years (95% CI, 0.52-1.59 quality-adjusted life-years); 80-year-old male cohort with significant comorbidities = 0.72 quality-adjusted life-years (95% CI, 0.34-1.76 quality-adjusted life-years)) and less costly (60-year-old male cohort with no comorbidities = $11,332.35 (95% CI, $668.50-$23,970.20); 80-year-old male cohort with no comorbidities = $8783.93 (95% CI, $2504.26-$21,900.66); 80-year-old male cohort with significant comorbidities = $10,206.01 (95% CI, $2762.014-$24,135.31)) independent of patient cohort age and comorbidity. Consequently, watch and wait was more cost-effective with a high degree of certainty (range, 69.6%-89.2%) at a threshold of $50,000/quality-adjusted life-year. LIMITATIONS: Long-term outcomes were derived from modeled cohorts. Analysis was performed for a United Kingdom third-party payer perspective, limiting generalizability to other healthcare contexts. CONCLUSIONS: Watch and wait is likely to be cost-effective compared with radical surgery. These findings strongly support the discussion of organ-preserving strategies with suitable patients.";0
Development and validation of a nomogram for predicting the survival of patients with non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma after curative treatment.;BACKGROUND: The TNM staging system is far from perfect in predicting the survival of individual cancer patients because only the gross anatomy is considered. The survival rates of the patients who have the same TNM stage disease vary across a wide spectrum. This study aimed to develop a nomogram that incorporates other clinicopathologic factors for predicting the overall survival (OS) of non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients after curative treatments. METHODS: We retrospectively collected the clinical data of 1520 NPC patients who were diagnosed histologically between November 2000 and September 2003. The clinical data of a separate cohort of 464 patients who received intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) between 2001 and 2010 were also retrieved to examine the extensibility of the model. Cox regression analysis was used to identify the prognostic factors for building the nomogram. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability were measured using the concordance index (c-index). RESULTS: We identified and incorporated 12 independent clinical factors into the nomogram. The calibration curves showed that the prediction of OS was in good agreement with the actual observation in the internal validation set and IMRT cohort. The c-index of the nomogram was statistically higher than that of the 7th edition TNM staging system for predicting the survival in both the primary cohort (0.69 vs. 0.62) and the IMRT cohort (0.67 vs. 0.63). CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a novel nomogram that outperformed the TNM staging system in predicting the OS of non-metastatic NPC patients who underwent curative therapy.;0
Imaging biomarker roadmap for cancer studies.;"Imaging biomarkers (IBs) are integral to the routine management of patients with cancer. IBs used daily in oncology include clinical TNM stage, objective response and left ventricular ejection fraction. Other CT, MRI, PET and ultrasonography biomarkers are used extensively in cancer research and drug development. New IBs need to be established either as useful tools for testing research hypotheses in clinical trials and research studies, or as clinical decision-making tools for use in healthcare, by crossing 'translational gaps' through validation and qualification. Important differences exist between IBs and biospecimen-derived biomarkers and, therefore, the development of IBs requires a tailored 'roadmap'. Recognizing this need, Cancer Research UK (CRUK) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) assembled experts to review, debate and summarize the challenges of IB validation and qualification. This consensus group has produced 14 key recommendations for accelerating the clinical translation of IBs, which highlight the role of parallel (rather than sequential) tracks of technical (assay) validation, biological/clinical validation and assessment of cost-effectiveness; the need for IB standardization and accreditation systems; the need to continually revisit IB precision; an alternative framework for biological/clinical validation of IBs; and the essential requirements for multicentre studies to qualify IBs for clinical use.";0
Predictors of Treatment Decisions in Multidisciplinary Oncology Meetings: A Quantitative Observational Study.;BACKGROUND: In many healthcare systems, treatment recommendations for cancer patients are formulated by multidisciplinary tumor boards (MTBs). Evidence suggests that interdisciplinary contributions to case reviews in the meetings are unequal and information-sharing suboptimal, with biomedical information dominating over information on patient comorbidities and psychosocial factors. This study aimed to evaluate how different elements of the decision process affect the teams' ability to reach a decision on first case review. METHODS: This was an observational quantitative assessment of 1045 case reviews from 2010 to 2014 in cancer MTBs using a validated tool, the Metric for the Observation of Decision-making. This tool allows evaluation of the quality of information presentation (case history, radiological, pathological, and psychosocial information, comorbidities, and patient views), and contribution to discussion by individual core specialties (surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, and specialist cancer nurses). The teams' ability to reach a decision was a dichotomous outcome variable (yes/no). RESULTS: Using multiple logistic regression analysis, the significant positive predictors of the teams' ability to reach a decision were patient psychosocial information (odds ratio [OR] 1.35) and the inputs of surgeons (OR 1.62), radiologists (OR 1.48), pathologists (OR 1.23), and oncologists (OR 1.13). The significant negative predictors were patient comorbidity information (OR 0.83) and nursing inputs (OR 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary inputs into case reviews and patient psychosocial information stimulate decision making, thereby reinforcing the role of MTBs in cancer care in processing such information. Information on patients' comorbidities, as well as nursing inputs, make decision making harder, possibly indicating that a case is complex and requires more detailed review. Research should further define case complexity and determine ways to better integrate patient psychosocial information into decision making.;0
A qualitative study to understand guideline-discordant use of imaging to stage incident prostate cancer.;BACKGROUND: Approximately half of veterans with low-risk prostate cancer receive guideline-discordant imaging. Our objective was to identify and describe (1) physician knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to the use of imaging to stage prostate cancer, (2) patient attitudes and behaviors related to use of imaging, and (3) to compare responses across three VA medical centers (VAMCs). METHODS: A qualitative approach was used to explore patient and provider knowledge and behaviors relating to the use of imaging. We conducted 39 semi-structured interviews total-including 22 interviews with patients with newly diagnosed with prostate cancer and 17 interviews with physicians caring for them-between September 2014 and July 2015 at three VAMCs representing a spectrum of inappropriate imaging rates. After core theoretical concepts were identified, the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was selected to explore linkages between themes within the dataset and existing domains within the framework. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and then coded and analyzed using Nvivo software. RESULTS: Themes from patient interviews were categorized within four TDF domains. Patients reported little interest in staging as compared to disease treatment (goals), and many could not remember if they had imaging at all (knowledge). Patients tended to trust their doctor to make decisions about appropriate tests (beliefs about capabilities). Some patients expressed a minor concern for radiation exposure, but anxiety about cancer outcomes outweighed these fears (emotion). Themes from physician interviews were categorized within five TDF domains. Most physicians self-reported that they know and trust imaging guidelines (knowledge) yet some were still likely to follow their own intuition, whether due to clinical suspicion or years of experience (beliefs about capabilities). Additionally, physicians reported that medico-legal concerns, fear of missing associated diagnoses (beliefs about consequences), influence from colleagues who image frequently (social influences), and the facility where they practice influences rates of imaging (environmental context). CONCLUSIONS: Interviews with patients and physicians suggest that physicians are the primary (and in some cases only) decision-makers regarding staging imaging for prostate cancer. This finding suggests a physician-targeted intervention may be the most effective strategy to improve guideline-concordant prostate cancer imaging.;0
Moving Evidence Forward: Addressing the Barriers to Evidence-Based Practice in Radiotherapy.;Improving the quality of care is an ongoing challenge for medical professionals in the Canadian healthcare system. One generally accepted method of improving health outcomes has been the clinical implementation of evidence-based practice. Historically, the barrier in clinical settings has been efficient access to reliable information. Point-of-care (P-O-C) tools have been proven to be effective and help promote evidence-based practice in professions outside radiation therapy. To examine the potential usefulness of a P-O-C tool for radiation therapists, a Canada-wide survey was distributed to practicing radiation therapists. Results showed a clear desire by radiation therapists for a P-O-C tool. Sixty-nine percent of surveyed practitioners stated that having a practitioner-focused evidence resource would change their daily work practice, but stipulated that the proper integration of resources into the day-to-day workplace is crucial to supporting clinical evidence-based decision-making. Study participants also highlighted several barriers to their ability to do so, including access to evidence-based data, differing organizational research philosophies and practices, lack of resources to promote discipline-specific practitioner research, and necessary integration of educational and mentoring programs into daily practices. Although they have not been found to be an all-encompassing remedy, P-O-C tools have the potential to aid front-line healthcare providers in fostering evidence-based practice.;0
Use of Clinical Decision Guidance as a New Public Health Tool for the Medical Management of Internal Contamination in Radiological Mass Casualty Scenarios.;This review is a discussion of special issues associated with the medical and public health management of persons at risk of internal contamination from radionuclides, following various radiological mass-casualty scenarios, as well as definition, discussion and use of the Clinical Decision Guidance (CDG) in such scenarios. Specific medical countermeasures are available for reducing the internal radiation dose and the subsequent stochastic and deterministic risks to persons internally contaminated with radionuclides from nuclear power plant, fuel processing and nuclear weapon accidents/incidents. There is a public health need for rapidly identifying and quantifying the 'source term' of such radiation exposures and assessment of the associated committed doses, so that appropriate medical countermeasure(s) can be given as soon as possible. The CDG, which was initially defined in NCRP-161, was specifically developed to be a new public health tool for facilitating the integration of local community healthcare professionals into the general medical, mass casualty, triage and treatment response of internally contaminated populations.;0
A scoring system basing pathological parameters to predict regional lymph node metastasis after preoperative chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer: implication for local excision.;Local excision is an alternative to radical surgery that is indicated in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) who have a good response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Regional lymph node status is a major uncertainty during local excision of LARC following CRT. We retrospectively reviewed clinicopathologic variables for 244 patients with LARC who were treated at our institute between December 2000 and December 2013 in order to identify independent predictors of regional lymph node metastasis. Multivariate analysis of the training sample demonstrated that histopathologic type, tumor size, and the presence of lymphovascular invasion were significant predictors of regional nodal metastasis. These variables were then incorporated into a scoring system in which the total scores were calculated based on the points assigned for each parameter. The area under the curve in the receiver operating characteristic analysis was 0.750, and the cutoff value for the total score to predict regional nodal metastasis was 7.5. The sensitivity of our system was 73.2% and the specificity was 69.4%. The sensitivity was 77.8% and the specificity was 51.2% when the scoring system was applied to the testing sample. Using this system, we could accurately predict regional nodal metastases in LARC patients following CRT, which may be useful for stratifying patients in clinical trials and selecting potential candidates for organ-sparing surgery following CRT for LARC.;0

Implementation of a patient decision aid for men with localized prostate cancer: evaluation of patient outcomes and practice variation.;"BACKGROUND: Men with localized prostate cancer often have unrealistic expectations. Practitioners are poor judges of men's preferences, contributing to preference misdiagnosis and unwarranted practice variation. Patient decision aids (PtDAs) can support men with decisions about localized prostate cancer. This is a comparative case study of two strategies for implementing PtDAs in clinical pathways for men with localized prostate cancer, evaluating (a) PtDA use; (b) impact on men, practitioners, and health system outcomes; and (c) factors influencing sustained use. METHODS/DESIGN: Guided by the Knowledge to Action Framework, this comparative case study will be conducted using administrative data, interviews, and surveys. Cases will be bound by geographic location (one hospital in Ontario; province of Saskatchewan) and time. Eligible participants will be all men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer, with outcomes assessed using administrative data and interviews. Nurses, urologists, radiation oncologists, and managers will be surveyed and a smaller sample interviewed. Cases will be established for each setting with findings compared across cases. Changes in the proportions of men given the PtDA over 2 years will be determined from administrative data. Factors associated with receiving the PtDA will be explored using multivariable logistic regression analysis. To assess the impact of the PtDA, outcomes will be described using mean and standard deviation (men's decisional conflict) and frequency and proportions (practitioners consulted, uptake of treatment). To estimate the effect of the PtDA on these outcomes, adjusted mean differences and odds ratios will be calculated using exploratory multivariable general linear regression and binary or multinomial logistic regression. Factors influencing sustained PtDA use will be assessed using descriptive analysis of survey findings and thematic analysis of interview transcripts. DISCUSSION: Determining how to embed PtDAs effectively within clinical pathways for men with localized prostate cancer is essential. PtDAs have the potential to strengthen men's active role in making prostate cancer decisions, enhance uptake of shared decision-making by practitioners, and reduce practice variation. Our team of researchers and knowledge users will use findings to improve current PtDA use and consider scaling-up implementation.";0
Significance of Bioindicators for Early Predictions on Diagnosis and Therapy of Irradiated Minipigs.;Decisions on whether to start a therapeutic intervention for management of the Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) should be made early after exposure, and it should be based on readily available clinical signs and laboratory parameters. Here, the authors use the minipig to assess if early prediction of the later developing clinical outcome and necessity of therapeutic interventions can be determined within the first 3 d after exposure and whether it is comparable to human data. Retrospective analysis of data accumulated in the period 2009-2012 was used. Male Gottingen minipigs (age 4-5 mo, weight 9-10 kg) were irradiated (or sham-irradiated) bilaterally with gamma-photons (Co, 0.5-0.6 Gy min) in the dose range of 1.6-12 Gy. Complete blood counts, serum chemistry, and clinical symptoms were collected up to 60 d after irradiation in untreated minipigs. Changes in these early parameters (up to 3 d after exposure) were correlated with later occurrence (10-60 d after irradiation) of (1) hematological severity scores, (2) severe thrombocytopenia, (3) severe neutropenia, as well as need for (4) therapeutic intervention, (5) administration of cytokines/antibiotics, or (6) thrombocyte transfusions. Binary endpoints were analyzed using logistic regression analysis and calculating receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Most predictive were decreased lymphocyte counts and increases in body temperature at 3 h after irradiation. These data corroborate earlier findings performed on human radiation victims suffering from severe hematological syndrome and provide further evidence for the suitability of the minipig model as a potential alternative non-rodent animal model.;0
The Physician Recommendation Coding System (PhyReCS): A Reliable and Valid Method to Quantify the Strength of Physician Recommendations During Clinical Encounters.;BACKGROUND: Physicians' recommendations affect patients' treatment choices. However, most research relies on physicians' or patients' retrospective reports of recommendations, which offer a limited perspective and have limitations such as recall bias. OBJECTIVE: To develop a reliable and valid method to measure the strength of physician recommendations using direct observation of clinical encounters. METHODS: Clinical encounters (n = 257) were recorded as part of a larger study of prostate cancer decision making. We used an iterative process to create the 5-point Physician Recommendation Coding System (PhyReCS). To determine reliability, research assistants double-coded 50 transcripts. To establish content validity, we used 1-way analyses of variance to determine whether relative treatment recommendation scores differed as a function of which treatment patients received. To establish concurrent validity, we examined whether patients' perceived treatment recommendations matched our coded recommendations. RESULTS: The PhyReCS was highly reliable (Krippendorf's alpha = 0.89, 95% CI [0.86, 0.91]). The average relative treatment recommendation score for each treatment was higher for individuals who received that particular treatment. For example, the average relative surgery recommendation score was higher for individuals who received surgery versus radiation (mean difference = 0.98, SE = 0.18, P < 0.001) or active surveillance (mean difference = 1.10, SE = 0.14, P < 0.001). Patients' perceived recommendations matched coded recommendations 81% of the time. CONCLUSION: The PhyReCS is a reliable and valid way to capture the strength of physician recommendations. We believe that the PhyReCS would be helpful for other researchers who wish to study physician recommendations, an important part of patient decision making.;0
Management and Care of Women With Invasive Cervical Cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology Resource-Stratified Clinical Practice Guideline.;"PURPOSE: To provide evidence-based, resource-stratified global recommendations to clinicians and policymakers on the management and palliative care of women diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer. METHODS: ASCO convened a multidisciplinary, multinational panel of cancer control, medical and radiation oncology, health economic, obstetric and gynecologic, and palliative care experts to produce recommendations reflecting resource-tiered settings. A systematic review of literature from 1966 to 2015 failed to yield sufficiently strong quality evidence to support basic- and limited-resource setting recommendations; a formal consensus-based process was used to develop recommendations. A modified ADAPTE process was also used to adapt recommendations from existing guidelines. RESULTS: Five existing sets of guidelines were identified and reviewed, and adapted recommendations form the evidence base. Eight systematic reviews, along with cost-effectiveness analyses, provided indirect evidence to inform the consensus process, which resulted in agreement of 75% or greater. RECOMMENDATIONS: Clinicians and planners should strive to provide access to the most effective evidence-based antitumor and palliative care interventions. If a woman cannot access these within her own or neighboring country or region, she may need to be treated with lower-tier modalities, depending on capacity and resources for surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and supportive and palliative care. For women with early-stage cervical cancer in basic settings, cone biopsy or extrafascial hysterectomy may be performed. Fertility-sparing procedures or modified radical or radical hysterectomy may be additional options in nonbasic settings. Combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy (including brachytherapy) should be used for women with stage IB to IVA disease, depending on available resources. Pain control is a vital component of palliative care. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/rs-cervical-cancer-treatment-guideline and www.asco.org/guidelineswiki. It is the view of ASCO that health care providers and health care system decision makers should be guided by the recommendations for the highest stratum of resources available. The guideline is intended to complement but not replace local guidelines.";0
Optimization of stereotactic body radiotherapy treatment planning using a multicriteria optimization algorithm.;PURPOSE: To provide high-quality and efficient dosimetric planning for various types of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for tumor treatment using a multicriteria optimization (MCO) technique fine-tuned with direct machine parameter optimization (DMPO). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighteen patients with lung (n=11), liver (n=5) or adrenal cell cancer (n=2) were treated using SBRT in our clinic between December 2014 and June 2015. Plans were generated using the RayStation Treatment Planning System (TPS) with the VMAT technique. Optimal deliverable SBRT plans were first generated using an MCO algorithm to find a well-balanced tradeoff between tumor control and normal tissue sparing in an efficient treatment planning time. Then, the deliverable plan was post-processed using the MCO solution as the starting point for the DMPO algorithm to improve the dose gradient around the planning target volume (PTV) while maintaining the clinician's priorities. The dosimetric quality of the plans was evaluated using dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters, which account for target coverage and the sparing of healthy tissue, as well as the CI100 and CI50 conformity indexes. RESULTS: Using a combination of the MCO and DMPO algorithms showed that the treatment plans were clinically optimal and conformed to all organ risk dose volume constraints reported in the literature, with a computation time of approximately one hour. The coverage of the PTV (D99% and D95%) and sparing of organs at risk (OAR) were similar between the MCO and MCO+DMPO plans, with no significant differences (p>0.05) for all the SBRT plans. The average CI100 and CI50 values using MCO+DMPO were significantly better than those with MCO alone (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The MCO technique allows for convergence on an optimal solution for SBRT within an efficient planning time. The combination of the MCO and DMPO techniques yields a better dose gradient, especially for lung tumors.;0
Implementation of a rapid learning platform: Predicting 2-year survival in laryngeal carcinoma patients in a clinical setting.;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To improve quality and personalization of oncology health care, decision aid tools are needed to advise physicians and patients. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the clinical relevance of a survival prediction model as a first step to multi institutional rapid learning and compare this to a clinical trial dataset. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data extraction and mining tools were used to collect uncurated input parameters from Illawarra Cancer Care Centre's (clinical cohort) oncology information system. Prognosis categories previously established from the Maastricht Radiation Oncology (training cohort) dataset, were applied to the clinical cohort and the radiotherapy only arm of the RTOG-9111 (trial cohort). RESULTS: Data mining identified 125 laryngeal carcinoma patients, ending up with 52 patients in the clinical cohort who were eligible to be evaluated by the model to predict 2-year survival and 177 for the trial cohort. The model was able to classify patients and predict survival in the clinical cohort, but for the trial cohort it failed to do so. CONCLUSIONS: The technical infrastructure and model is able to support the prognosis prediction of laryngeal carcinoma patients in a clinical cohort. The model does not perform well for the highly selective patient population in the trial cohort.;0
Establishing Cost-Effective Allocation of Proton Therapy for Breast Irradiation.;PURPOSE: Cardiac toxicity due to conventional breast radiation therapy (RT) has been extensively reported, and it affects both the life expectancy and quality of life of affected women. Given the favorable oncologic outcomes in most women irradiated for breast cancer, it is increasingly paramount to minimize treatment side effects and improve survivorship for these patients. Proton RT offers promise in limiting heart dose, but the modality is costly and access is limited. Using cost-effectiveness analysis, we provide a decision-making tool to help determine which breast cancer patients may benefit from proton RT referral. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Markov cohort model was constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness of proton versus photon RT for breast cancer management. The model was analyzed for different strata of women based on age (40 years, 50 years, and 60 years) and the presence or lack of cardiac risk factors (CRFs). Model entrants could have 1 of 3 health states: healthy, alive with coronary heart disease (CHD), or dead. Base-case analysis assumed CHD was managed medically. No difference in tumor control was assumed between arms. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to test model robustness and the influence of including catheterization as a downstream possibility within the health state of CHD. RESULTS: Proton RT was not cost-effective in women without CRFs or a mean heart dose (MHD) <5 Gy. Base-case analysis noted cost-effectiveness for proton RT in women with >/=1 CRF at an approximate minimum MHD of 6 Gy with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year. For women with >/=1 CRF, probabilistic sensitivity analysis noted the preference of proton RT for an MHD >/=5 Gy with a similar willingness-to-pay threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the cost of treatment, scenarios do exist whereby proton therapy is cost-effective. Referral for proton therapy may be cost-effective for patients with >/=1 CRF in cases for which photon plans are unable to achieve an MHD <5 Gy.;0
Personalized treatment planning with a model of radiation therapy outcomes for use in multiobjective optimization of IMRT plans for prostate cancer.;PURPOSE: To build a new treatment planning approach that extends beyond radiation transport and IMRT optimization by modeling the radiation therapy process and prognostic indicators for more outcome-focused decision making. METHODS: An in-house treatment planning system was modified to include multiobjective inverse planning, a probabilistic outcome model, and a multi-attribute decision aid. A genetic algorithm generated a set of plans embodying trade-offs between the separate objectives. An influence diagram network modeled the radiation therapy process of prostate cancer using expert opinion, results of clinical trials, and published research. A Markov model calculated a quality adjusted life expectancy (QALE), which was the endpoint for ranking plans. RESULTS: The Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) was designed to produce an approximation of the Pareto Front representing optimal tradeoffs for IMRT plans. Prognostic information from the dosimetrics of the plans, and from patient-specific clinical variables were combined by the influence diagram. QALEs were calculated for each plan for each set of patient characteristics. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore changes in outcomes for variations in patient characteristics and dosimetric variables. The model calculated life expectancies that were in agreement with an independent clinical study. CONCLUSIONS: The radiation therapy model proposed has integrated a number of different physical, biological and clinical models into a more comprehensive model. It illustrates a number of the critical aspects of treatment planning that can be improved and represents a more detailed description of the therapy process. A Markov model was implemented to provide a stronger connection between dosimetric variables and clinical outcomes and could provide a practical, quantitative method for making difficult clinical decisions.;0
Technical Note: Relationships between gamma criteria and action levels: Results of a multicenter audit of gamma agreement index results.;PURPOSE: The aim of this work was to use a multicenter audit of modulated radiotherapy quality assurance (QA) data to provide a practical examination of gamma evaluation criteria and action level selection. The use of the gamma evaluation method for patient-specific pretreatment QA is widespread, with most commercial solutions implementing the method. METHODS: Gamma agreement indices were calculated using the criteria 1%/1 mm, 2%/2 mm, 2%/3 mm, 3%/2 mm, 3%/3 mm, and 5%/3 mm for 1265 pretreatment QA measurements, planned at seven treatment centers, using four different treatment planning systems, delivered using three different delivery systems (intensity-modulated radiation therapy, volumetric-modulated arc therapy, and helical tomotherapy) and measured using three different dose measurement systems. The sensitivity of each pair of gamma criteria was evaluated relative to the gamma agreement indices calculated using 3%/3 mm. RESULTS: A linear relationship was observed for 2%/2 mm, 2%/3 mm, and 3%/2 mm. This result implies that most beams failing at 3%/3 mm would also fail for those criteria, if the action level was adjusted appropriately. Some borderline plans might be passed or failed depending on the relative priority (tighter tolerance) used for dose difference or distance to agreement evaluation. Dosimeter resolution and treatment modality were found to have a smaller effect on the results of QA measurements than the number of dimensions (2D or 3D) over which the gamma evaluation was calculated. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides a method (and a large sample of results) for calculating equivalent action levels for different gamma evaluation criteria. This work constitutes a valuable guide for clinical decision making and a means to compare published gamma evaluation results from studies using different evaluation criteria. More generally, the data provided by this work support the recommendation that gamma criteria that specifically prioritize the property of greatest clinical importance for each treatment modality of anatomical site should be selected when using gamma evaluations for modulated radiotherapy QA. It is therefore suggested that departments using the gamma evaluation as a QA analysis tool should consider the relative importance of dose difference and distance to agreement, when selecting gamma evaluation criteria.;0
Detection of Local Cancer Recurrence After Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy for Lung Cancer: Physician Performance Versus Radiomic Assessment.;PURPOSE: Stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) is a guideline-specified treatment option for early-stage lung cancer. However, significant posttreatment fibrosis can occur and obfuscate the detection of local recurrence. The goal of this study was to assess physician ability to detect timely local recurrence and to compare physician performance with a radiomics tool. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Posttreatment computed tomography (CT) scans (n=182) from 45 patients treated with SABR (15 with local recurrence matched to 30 with no local recurrence) were used to measure physician and radiomic performance in assessing response. Scans were individually scored by 3 thoracic radiation oncologists and 3 thoracic radiologists, all of whom were blinded to clinical outcomes. Radiomic features were extracted from the same images. Performances of the physician assessors and the radiomics signature were compared. RESULTS: When taking into account all CT scans during the whole follow-up period, median sensitivity for physician assessment of local recurrence was 83% (range, 67%-100%), and specificity was 75% (range, 67%-87%), with only moderate interobserver agreement (kappa = 0.54) and a median time to detection of recurrence of 15.5 months. When determining the early prediction of recurrence within <6 months after SABR, physicians assessed the majority of images as benign injury/no recurrence, with a mean error of 35%, false positive rate (FPR) of 1%, and false negative rate (FNR) of 99%. At the same time point, a radiomic signature consisting of 5 image-appearance features demonstrated excellent discrimination, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85, classification error of 24%, FPR of 24%, and FNR of 23%. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that radiomics can detect early changes associated with local recurrence that are not typically considered by physicians. This decision support system could potentially allow for early salvage therapy of patients with local recurrence after SABR.;0
Imaging texture analysis for automated prediction of lung cancer recurrence after stereotactic radiotherapy.;Benign radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is not uncommon following stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for lung cancer and can be difficult to differentiate from tumor recurrence on follow-up imaging. We previously showed the ability of computed tomography (CT) texture analysis to predict recurrence. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the accuracy of recurrence prediction using manual region-of-interest segmentation to that of a semiautomatic approach. We analyzed 22 patients treated for 24 lesions (11 recurrences, 13 RILI). Consolidative and ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions were manually delineated. The longest axial diameter of the consolidative region on each post-SABR CT image was measured. This line segment is routinely obtained as part of the clinical imaging workflow and was used as input to automatically delineate the consolidative region and subsequently derive a periconsolidative region to sample GGO tissue. Texture features were calculated, and at two to five months post-SABR, the entropy texture measure within the semiautomatic segmentations showed prediction accuracies [areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.70 to 0.73] similar to those of manual GGO segmentations (AUC: 0.64). After integration into the clinical workflow, this decision support system has the potential to support earlier salvage for patients with recurrence and fewer investigations of benign RILI.;0
Preablative Stimulated Thyroglobulin Correlates to New Therapy Response System in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer.;"CONTEXT: Studies suggested a potential value of preablative stimulated thyroglobulin (ps-Tg) on predicting the recurrent and persistent diseases of differentiated thyroid cancer, whereas its correlations with therapeutic response remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To establish the correlation between ps-Tg and therapeutic response proposed in 2015 American Thyroid Association guidelines, and calculate a cutoff ps-Tg threshold for predicting a poor response. DESIGN/SETTING: Patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine therapy in a university hospital participated in this retrospective study. PATIENTS: Totally, 452 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer were followed for a median of 38 months and were divided into three groups in terms of ps-Tg level: group 1, less than 1 ng/ml (n = 82); group 2, 1-10 ng/ml (n = 173); and group 3, at least 10 ng/ml (n = 197). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical outcomes were assessed based on response to therapy restaging system, dividing responses into excellent, indeterminate, biomedical incomplete, and structural incomplete (SIR). RESULTS: Therapeutic responses could be obviously distinguished by different ps-Tg strata. SIR was identified in none of group 1, 1.73% of group 2, and 42.74% of group 3, respectively (chi(2) = 123.037, P < .001). A cutoff value of ps-Tg at 26.75 ng/ml was obtained by receiver operating characteristic curve for differentiating SIR from either excellent, indeterminate, or biomedical incomplete responses. The area under curve was 0.947 and negative predictive value was 96.99%. Ps-Tg was an independent predictive variable of SIR (odds ratio, 42.312; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Ps-Tg has a great performance in predicting therapeutic response and providing incremental value for decision making of radioactive iodine therapy, especially for patients with high ps-Tg level.";0
Physical examination of the female cancer patient with sexual concerns: What oncologists and patients should expect from consultation with a specialist.;"Answer questions and earn CME/CNE Sexual concerns are prevalent in women with cancer or cancer history and are a factor in patient decision making about cancer treatment and risk-reduction options. Physical examination of the female cancer patient with sexual concerns, regardless of the type or site of her cancer, is an essential and early component of a comprehensive evaluation and effective treatment plan. Specialized practices are emerging that focus specifically on evaluation and treatment of women with cancer and sexual function problems. As part of a specialized evaluation, oncologists and their patients should expect a thorough physical examination to identify or rule out physical causes of sexual problems or dysfunction. This review provides oncology professionals with a description of the physical examination of the female cancer patient with sexual function concerns. This description aims to inform anticipatory guidance for the patient and to assist in interpreting specialists' findings and recommendations. In centers or regions where specialized care is not yet available, this review can also be used by oncology practices to educate and support health care providers interested in expanding their practices to treat women with cancer and sexual function concerns.

Decision support systems for personalized and participative radiation oncology.;A paradigm shift from current population based medicine to personalized and participative medicine is underway. This transition is being supported by the development of clinical decision support systems based on prediction models of treatment outcome. In radiation oncology, these models 'learn' using advanced and innovative information technologies (ideally in a distributed fashion - please watch the animation: http://youtu.be/ZDJFOxpwqEA) from all available/appropriate medical data (clinical, treatment, imaging, biological/genetic, etc.) to achieve the highest possible accuracy with respect to prediction of tumor response and normal tissue toxicity. In this position paper, we deliver an overview of the factors that are associated with outcome in radiation oncology and discuss the methodology behind the development of accurate prediction models, which is a multi-faceted process. Subsequent to initial development/validation and clinical introduction, decision support systems should be constantly re-evaluated (through quality assurance procedures) in different patient datasets in order to refine and re-optimize the models, ensuring the continuous utility of the models. In the reasonably near future, decision support systems will be fully integrated within the clinic, with data and knowledge being shared in a standardized, dynamic, and potentially global manner enabling truly personalized and participative medicine.;0
Impact of vision loss among survivors of childhood central nervous system astroglial tumors.;"BACKGROUND: The impact of impaired vision on cognitive and psychosocial outcomes among long-term survivors of childhood low-grade gliomas has not been investigated previously but could inform therapeutic decision making. METHODS: Data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study were used to investigate psychological outcomes (measures of cognitive/emotional function) and socioeconomic outcomes (education, income, employment, marital status, and independent living) among astroglial tumor survivors grouped by 1) vision without impairment, 2) vision with impairment (including unilateral blindness, visual field deficits, and amblyopia), or 3) bilateral blindness. The effect of vision status on outcomes was examined with multivariate logistic regression with adjustments for age, sex, cranial radiation therapy, and medical comorbidities. RESULTS: Among 1233 survivors of childhood astroglial tumors 5 or more years after their diagnosis, 277 (22.5%) had visual impairment. In a multivariate analysis, survivors with bilateral blindness were more likely to be unmarried (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-15.0), live with a caregiver (adjusted OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3-7.5), and be unemployed (adjusted OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.5) in comparison with those without visual impairment. Bilateral blindness had no measurable effect on cognitive or emotional outcomes, and vision with impairment was not significantly associated with any psychological or socioeconomic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adult survivors of childhood astroglial tumors with bilateral blindness were more likely to live unmarried and dependently and to be unemployed. Survivors with visual impairment but some remaining vision did not differ significantly with respect to psychological function and socioeconomic status from those without visual impairment.

Standardized data collection to build prediction models in oncology: a prototype for rectal cancer.;The advances in diagnostic and treatment technology are responsible for a remarkable transformation in the internal medicine concept with the establishment of a new idea of personalized medicine. Inter- and intra-patient tumor heterogeneity and the clinical outcome and/or treatment's toxicity's complexity, justify the effort to develop predictive models from decision support systems. However, the number of evaluated variables coming from multiple disciplines: oncology, computer science, bioinformatics, statistics, genomics, imaging, among others could be very large thus making traditional statistical analysis difficult to exploit. Automated data-mining processes and machine learning approaches can be a solution to organize the massive amount of data, trying to unravel important interaction. The purpose of this paper is to describe the strategy to collect and analyze data properly for decision support and introduce the concept of an 'umbrella protocol' within the framework of 'rapid learning healthcare'.;0
Wait times for prostate cancer treatment and patient perceptions of care in Canada: a mixed-methods report.;BACKGROUND: Access to cancer care is a significant concern for Canadians. Prolonged delays between cancer diagnosis and treatment have been associated with anxiety, stress, and perceived powerlessness for patients and their family members. Longer wait times can also be associated with poorer prognosis, although the evidence is inconclusive. Here, we report national wait times for radiation therapy and surgery for localized prostate cancer (pca) and the effect of wait time on patient perceptions of their care. RESULTS: Treatment wait times showed substantial interprovincial variation. The longest 90th percentile wait times for radiation therapy and surgery were, respectively, 40 days and 105 days. In all provinces, waits for radiation therapy were longer for pca patients than for patients with breast, colorectal, or lung cancer. In the focus groups and interviews conducted with 47 men treated for pca, many participants did not perceive that wait times for treatment were prolonged. Those who experienced delays between diagnosis and treatment voiced issues with a lack of communication about when they would receive treatment and a lack of support or information to make an informed decision about treatment. Minimizing treatment delays was an aspect of the cancer journey that participants would like to change because of the stress it caused. CONCLUSIONS: Although wait time statistics are useful, a review of cancer control in Canada cannot be considered complete unless an effort is made to give voice to the experiences of individuals with cancer. The findings presented here are intended to provide a snapshot of national care delivery for localized pca and to identify opportunities for improvement in clinical practice.;0
Spleen Volume Variation in Patients with Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving Platinum-Based Chemo-Radiotherapy.;"There is renewed interest in the immune regulatory role of the spleen in oncology. To date, very few studies have examined macroscopic variations of splenic volume in the setting of cancer, prior to or during therapy, especially in humans. Changes in splenic volume may be associated with changes in splenic function. The purpose of this study was to investigate variations in spleen volume in NSCLC patients during chemo-radiotherapy. Sixty patients with stage I-IIIB NSCLC underwent radiotherapy (60 Gy/30 fractions) for six weeks with concomitant carboplatin/paclitaxel (Ca/P; n = 32) or cisplatin/etoposide (Ci/E; n = 28). A baseline PET/CT scan was performed within 2 weeks prior to treatment and during Weeks 2 and 4 of chemo-radiotherapy. Spleen volume was measured by contouring all CT slices. Significant macroscopic changes in splenic volume occurred early after the commencement of treatment. A significant decrease in spleen volume was observed for 66% of Ca/P and 79% of Ci/E patients between baseline and Week 2. Spleen volume was decreased by 14.2% for Ca/P (p<0.001) and 19.3% for Ci/E (p<0.001) patients. By Week 4, spleen volume was still significantly decreased for Ca/P patients compared to baseline, while for Ci/E patients, spleen volume returned to above baseline levels. This is the first report demonstrating macroscopic changes in the spleen in NSCLC patients undergoing radical chemo-radiotherapy that can be visualized by non-invasive imaging.";0
Data-driven knowledge acquisition, validation, and transformation into HL7 Arden Syntax.;OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to help a team of physicians and knowledge engineers acquire clinical knowledge from existing practices datasets for treatment of head and neck cancer, to validate the knowledge against published guidelines, to create refined rules, and to incorporate these rules into clinical workflow for clinical decision support. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A team of physicians (clinical domain experts) and knowledge engineers adapt an approach for modeling existing treatment practices into final executable clinical models. For initial work, the oral cavity is selected as the candidate target area for the creation of rules covering a treatment plan for cancer. The final executable model is presented in HL7 Arden Syntax, which helps the clinical knowledge be shared among organizations. We use a data-driven knowledge acquisition approach based on analysis of real patient datasets to generate a predictive model (PM). The PM is converted into a refined-clinical knowledge model (R-CKM), which follows a rigorous validation process. The validation process uses a clinical knowledge model (CKM), which provides the basis for defining underlying validation criteria. The R-CKM is converted into a set of medical logic modules (MLMs) and is evaluated using real patient data from a hospital information system. RESULTS: We selected the oral cavity as the intended site for derivation of all related clinical rules for possible associated treatment plans. A team of physicians analyzed the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for the oral cavity and created a common CKM. Among the decision tree algorithms, chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID) was applied to a refined dataset of 1229 patients to generate the PM. The PM was tested on a disjoint dataset of 739 patients, which gives 59.0% accuracy. Using a rigorous validation process, the R-CKM was created from the PM as the final model, after conforming to the CKM. The R-CKM was converted into four candidate MLMs, and was used to evaluate real data from 739 patients, yielding efficient performance with 53.0% accuracy. CONCLUSION: Data-driven knowledge acquisition and validation against published guidelines were used to help a team of physicians and knowledge engineers create executable clinical knowledge. The advantages of the R-CKM are twofold: it reflects real practices and conforms to standard guidelines, while providing optimal accuracy comparable to that of a PM. The proposed approach yields better insight into the steps of knowledge acquisition and enhances collaboration efforts of the team of physicians and knowledge engineers.;0
Utilization of Prognostic Indexes for Patients with Brain Metastases in Daily Radiotherapy Routine -  is the Complexity and Intricacy Still an Issue?;BACKGROUND: Many prognostic indexes are available for patients with brain metastases in order to estimate remaining lifetime before selection of appropriate treatment including palliative radiotherapy. Their routine utilization is often deprecated for their complexity. We developed a practical tool based on widely available spreadsheet editors for facilitation of daily clinical use of selected indexes (RPA, GPA and WBRT 30) and evaluated its usage for retrospective single institutional survival analysis of patients irradiated for brain metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Spreadsheet platform was prepared and adjusted for automatic calculation of selected prognostic indexes after input of the relevant parameters. The consecutive series of newly diagnosed patients referred during 2011 to the palliative brain radiotherapy were analyzed, and real calculated survival parameters of individual subgroups of RPA, GPA and WBRT 30 were compared with estimated ones. Correlation of radiotherapy technique and estimated survival at the time of treatment indication was evaluated. RESULTS: Total of 121 patients (61% with multiple metastases) were irradiated with the majority undergoing whole brain radiotherapy. Median overall survival from the time of radiotherapy indication was 3.13 months. Non balanced distribution into individual scoring systems subgroups was observed with 8 (7%), 89 (73%) and 24 (20%) patients assigned to RPA 1, 2 and 3 subgroup, 3 (3%), 9 (7%), 57 (47%) and 52 (43%) patients assigned to GPA 3.5- 4, GPA 3.0, GPA 1.5- 2.5 and GPA 0- 1.0 subgroup and 10 (8%), 88 (73%) and 23 (19%) patients assigned to WBRT 30 subgroup D, B and A. Entire differences in overall survival between subgroups are significant among all three scoring systems. CONCLUSION: Routine calculation of available prognostic indexes is useful in decision making regarding the best radiotherapy of brain metastases, and their calculation is greatly facilitated by properly prepared widely available spreadsheet tools.;0
Predicting Pathological Features at Radical Prostatectomy in Patients with Prostate Cancer Eligible for Active Surveillance by Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging.;"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic performance of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) score in predicting pathologic features in a cohort of patients eligible for active surveillance who underwent radical prostatectomy. METHODS: A total of 223 patients who fulfilled the criteria for ""Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance"", were included. Mp-1.5 Tesla MRI examination staging with endorectal coil was performed at least 6-8 weeks after TRUS-guided biopsy. In all patients, the likelihood of the presence of cancer was assigned using PIRADS score between 1 and 5. Outcomes of interest were: Gleason score upgrading, extra capsular extension (ECE), unfavorable prognosis (occurrence of both upgrading and ECE), large tumor volume (>/= 0.5 ml), and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Decision Curve Analyses (DCA) were performed for models with and without inclusion of PIRADS score. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis demonstrated the association of PIRADS score with upgrading (P < 0.0001), ECE (P < 0.0001), unfavorable prognosis (P < 0.0001), and large tumor volume (P = 0.002). ROC curves and DCA showed that models including PIRADS score resulted in greater net benefit for almost all the outcomes of interest, with the only exception of SVI. CONCLUSIONS: mpMRI and PIRADS scoring are feasible tools in clinical setting and could be used as decision-support systems for a more accurate selection of patients eligible for AS.";0
Impact of dynamic changes to a bone metastases pathway in a large, integrated, National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center network.;"PURPOSE: Studies suggest equivalent pain relief from bone metastases after radiation therapy with >10-fraction regimens and shorter courses. Although American Society for Radiation Oncology evidence-based guidelines and the Choosing Wisely campaign endorse single-fraction treatments and caution against the use of extended courses, publications report single-fraction utilization rates below 5%. We evaluated the impact of our bone metastasis clinical pathway on the adoption of short-course palliative radiation in a large, integrated radiation oncology network. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We implemented a clinical pathway for the management of bone metastases in 2003 that required the entry of management decisions into an online tool that subjected off-pathway choices to peer review beginning in 2009. In 2014, the pathway was modified to encourage single-fraction treatments, and the use of >10 fractions was considered off pathway. Data were obtained from 16 integrated sites (4 academic, 12 community) from 2003 through 2014. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to establish factors associated with treatment with a single fraction and with >10 fractions. RESULTS: In this study, 12,678 unique courses were delivered. From 2003 to 2008, the single-fraction utilization rate was 7.6%. This increased to 10.9% from 2009 to 2013 and to 15.8% in 2014. The odds ratios for single-fraction use were 1.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-1.81) and 2.58 (95% CI, 2.11-3.15) for 2009-2013 and 2014, respectively. Academic physicians were more likely to treat with a single fraction (odds ratio, 5.00; 95% CI, 4.38-5.71). Use of >10-fraction regimens significantly decreased from 18.6% in 2003-2008 to 15.2% in 2009-2013 and 9.7% in 2014. CONCLUSIONS: Although our single-fraction utilization rate was initially in line with national rates (7.6%), the adoption rate increased to >15%. The use of >10-fraction regimens decreased significantly, predominantly among community practices. By 2014, >90% of courses were delivered with <10 fractions. This study demonstrates that provider-driven clinical pathways are able to standardize practice patterns and promote change consistent with evidence-based guidelines.";0
Safety and tolerability of sorafenib in patients with radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancer.;"Effective adverse event (AE) management is critical to maintaining patients on anticancer therapies. The DECISION trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial which investigated sorafenib for treatment of progressive, advanced, or metastatic radioactive iodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Four hundred and seventeen adult patients were randomized (1:1) to receive oral sorafenib (400 mg, twice daily) or placebo, until progression, unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance, or withdrawal. Progression-free survival, the primary endpoint of DECISION, was reported previously. To elucidate the patterns and management of AEs in sorafenib-treated patients in the DECISION trial, this report describes detailed, by-treatment-cycle analyses of the incidence, prevalence, and severity of hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), rash/desquamation, hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, increased serum thyroid stimulating hormone, and hypocalcemia, as well as the interventions used to manage these AEs. By-cycle incidence of the above-selected AEs with sorafenib was generally highest in cycle 1 or 2 then decreased. AE prevalence generally increased over cycles 2-6 then stabilized or declined. Among these AEs, only weight loss tended to increase in severity (from grade 1 to 2) over time; severity of HFSR and rash/desquamation declined over time. AEs were mostly grade 1 or 2, and were generally managed with dose interruptions/reductions, and concomitant medications (e.g. antidiarrheals, antihypertensives, dermatologic preparations). Most dose interruptions/reductions occurred in early cycles. In conclusion, AEs with sorafenib in DECISION were typically grade 1 or 2, occurred early during the treatment course, and were manageable over time.";0
The INTRABEAM(R) Photon Radiotherapy System for the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer: a systematic review and economic evaluation.;BACKGROUND: Initial treatment for early breast cancer is usually either breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or mastectomy. After BCS, whole-breast external beam radiotherapy (WB-EBRT) is the standard of care. A potential alternative to post-operative WB-EBRT is intraoperative radiation therapy delivered by the INTRABEAM((R)) Photon Radiotherapy System (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) to the tissue adjacent to the resection cavity at the time of surgery. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of INTRABEAM for the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer during surgical removal of the tumour. DATA SOURCES: Electronic bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library, were searched from inception to March 2014 for English-language articles. Bibliographies of articles, systematic reviews, clinical guidelines and the manufacturer's submission were also searched. The advisory group was contacted to identify additional evidence. METHODS: Systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness were conducted. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were applied to full texts of retrieved papers by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer, and differences in opinion were resolved through discussion at each stage. Clinical effectiveness studies were included if they were carried out in patients with early operable breast cancer. The intervention was the INTRABEAM system, which was compared with WB-EBRT, and study designs were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Controlled clinical trials could be considered if data from available RCTs were incomplete (e.g. absence of data on outcomes of interest). A cost-utility decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the costs, benefits and cost-effectiveness of INTRABEAM compared with WB-EBRT for early operable breast cancer. RESULTS: One non-inferiority RCT, TARGeted Intraoperative radioTherapy Alone (TARGIT-A), met the inclusion criteria for the review. The review found that local recurrence was slightly higher following INTRABEAM than WB-EBRT, but the difference did not exceed the 2.5% non-inferiority margin providing INTRABEAM was given at the same time as BCS. Overall survival was similar with both treatments. Statistically significant differences in complications were found for the occurrence of wound seroma requiring more than three aspirations (more frequent in the INTRABEAM group) and for a Radiation Therapy Oncology Group toxicity score of grade 3 or 4 (less frequent in the INTRABEAM group). Cost-effectiveness base-case analysis indicates that INTRABEAM is less expensive but also less effective than WB-EBRT because it is associated with lower total costs but fewer total quality-adjusted life-years gained. However, sensitivity analyses identified four model parameters that can cause a switch in the treatment option that is considered cost-effective. LIMITATIONS: The base-case result from the model is subject to uncertainty because the disease progression parameters are largely drawn from the single available RCT. The RCT median follow-up of 2 years 5 months may be inadequate, particularly as the number of participants with local recurrence is low. The model is particularly sensitive to this parameter. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: A significant investment in INTRABEAM equipment and staff training (clinical and non-clinical) would be required to make this technology available across the NHS. Longer-term follow-up data from the TARGIT-A trial and analysis of registry data are required as results are currently based on a small number of events and economic modelling results are uncertain.

A Systematic Review of Adjuvant Interventions for Radioiodine in Patients with Thyroid Cancer.;"AIMS: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of adjuvant interventions for radioiodine in patients with thyroid cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was undertaken on July 9, 2014. RevMan 5 software was used to synthesize data. RESULTS: 13 randomized controlled trials were included. The pooled risk ratio of 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.96-1.02, p = 0.58) indicated no significant difference in successful thyroid remnant ablation between recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) and thyroid hormone withdrawal in 7 trials. The percentage of patients who had successful ablation was significantly higher in the oral-lithium group than in the control group (p = 0.017). A computerized decision aid improves informed decision-making in patients with early-stage papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) who are considering adjuvant radioiodine treatment (p < 0.001). Amifostine pretreatment did not prevent parenchymal damage to the major salivary gland function after radioiodine treatment (p = 0.2461). CONCLUSIONS: The present systematic review suggests that rhTSH, lithium, and computerized decision aids maybe act as beneficial adjuvant interventions for radioiodine in patients with thyroid cancer; however, amifostine does not exhibit helpful effects in thyroid cancer patients treated with radioiodine.";0
Recurrent renal cell carcinoma: clinical and prognostic value of FDG PET/CT.;"PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was 1) to evaluate the diagnostic performance of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), 2) to assess the impact of FDG PET/CT on treatment decision-making, and 3) to estimate the prognostic value of FDG PET/CT in the restaging process among patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). METHODS: From the FDG PET/CT databases of San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy, and the Veneto Institute of Oncology in Padua, Italy, we selected 104 patients with a certain diagnosis of RCC after surgery, and for whom at least 24 months of post-surgical FDG PET/CT, clinical, and instrumental follow-up data was available. The sensitivity and specificity of FDG PET/CT were assessed by histology and/or other imaging as standard of reference. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were computed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify predictors of outcome. RESULTS: FDG PET/CT resulted in a positive diagnosis in 58 patients and a negative diagnosis in 46 patients. Sensitivity and specificity were 74% and 80%, respectively. FDG PET/CT findings influenced therapeutic management in 45/104 cases (43%). After a median follow-up period of 37 months (+/- standard deviation 12.9), 51 (49%) patients had recurrence of disease, and 26 (25%) had died. In analysis of OS, positive versus negative FDG PET/CT was associated with worse cumulative survival rates over a 5-year period (19% vs. 69%, respectively; p <0.05). Similarly, a positive FDG PET/CT correlated with a lower 3-year PFS rate. In addition, univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that a positive scan, alone or in combination with disease stage III-IV or nuclear grading 3-4, was associated with high risk of progression (multivariate analysis = hazard ratios [HRs] of 4.01, 3.7, and 2.8, respectively; all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: FDG PET/CT is a valuable tool both in treatment decision-making and for predicting survival and progression in patients affected by RCC.";0
High frequency and poor prognosis of late childhood BCR-ABL-positive and MLL-AF4-positive ALL define the need for advanced molecular diagnostics and improved therapeutic strategies in pediatric B-ALL in Pakistan.;"BACKGROUND: Fusion oncogenes (FOs) resulting from chromosomal abnormalities have an important role in leukemogenesis in pediatric B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The most common FOs are BCR-ABL, MLL-AF4, ETV6-RUNX1, and TCF3-PBX1, all of which have important prognostic and drug selection implications. Moreover, frequencies of FOs have ethnic variations. We studied Pakistani frequencies of FOs, clinical pattern, and outcome in pediatric B-ALL. METHODS: FOs were studied in 188 patients at diagnosis using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS: FOs were detected in 87.2 % of patients. Mean overall survival was 70.9 weeks, 3-year survival was 31.9 %, and 3-year relapse-free survival was 18.1 %. Four patients died of drug toxicities. ETV6-RUNX1 (19.14 %) had better survival (110.9 weeks; p = 0.03); TCF3-PBX1 (2.1 %) was associated with inferior outcome and higher central nervous system (CNS) relapse risk; MLL-AF4 (18.1 %) was more common in the 8- to 15-year age group (24/34; p = 0.001) and was associated with organomegaly, low platelet count, and poor survival; and BCR-ABL (47.9 %) was associated with older age (7-15 years, 52/90), lower remission rates, shorter survival (43.73 +/- 4.24 weeks) and higher white blood cell count. Overall, MLL-AF4 and BCR-ABL were detected in 66 % of B-ALL, presented in later childhood, and were associated with poor prognosis and inferior survival. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the highest ethnic frequency of BCR-ABL FO in pediatric ALL, and is consistent with previous reports from our region. Poor prognosis BCR-ABL and MLL-AF4 was detected in two-thirds of pediatric B-ALL and is likely to be the reason for the already reported poor survival of childhood ALL in South-East Asia. Furthermore, MLL-AF4, usually most common in infants, presented in later childhood in most of the ALL patients, which was one of the unique findings in our study. The results presented here highlight the need for mandatory inclusion of molecular testing for pediatric ALL patients in clinical decision making, together with the incorporation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as well as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation facilities, to improve treatment outcome for patients in developing countries.";0
Acute and Short-term Toxic Effects of Conventionally Fractionated vs Hypofractionated Whole-Breast Irradiation: A Randomized Clinical Trial.;"IMPORTANCE: The most appropriate dose fractionation for whole-breast irradiation (WBI) remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To assess acute and 6-month toxic effects and quality of life (QOL) with conventionally fractionated WBI (CF-WBI) vs hypofractionated WBI (HF-WBI). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Unblinded randomized trial of CF-WBI (n = 149; 50.00 Gy/25 fractions + boost [10.00-14.00 Gy/5-7 fractions]) vs HF-WBI (n = 138; 42.56 Gy/16 fractions + boost [10.00-12.50 Gy/4-5 fractions]) following breast-conserving surgery administered in community-based and academic cancer centers to 287 women 40 years or older with stage 0 to II breast cancer for whom WBI without addition of a third field was recommended; 76% of study participants (n = 217) were overweight or obese. Patients were enrolled from February 2011 through February 2014 and observed for a minimum of 6 months. INTERVENTIONS: Administration of CF-WBI or HF-WBI. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Physician-reported acute and 6-month toxic effects using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, and patient-reported QOL using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Patients with Breast Cancer (FACT-B). All analyses were intention to treat, with outcomes compared using the chi2 test, Cochran-Armitage test, and ordinal logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 287 participants, 149 were randomized to CF-WBI and 138 to HF-WBI. Treatment arms were well matched for baseline characteristics, including FACT-B total score (HF-WBI, 120.1 vs CF-WBI, 118.8; P = .46) and individual QOL items such as somewhat or more lack of energy (HF-WBI, 38% vs CF-WBI, 39%; P = .86) and somewhat or more trouble meeting family needs (HF-WBI, 10% vs CF-WBI, 14%; P = .54). Maximum physician-reported acute dermatitis (36% vs 69%; P < .001), pruritus (54% vs 81%; P < .001), breast pain (55% vs 74%; P = .001), hyperpigmentation (9% vs 20%; P = .002), and fatigue (9% vs 17%; P = .02) during irradiation were lower in patients randomized to HF-WBI. The rate of overall grade 2 or higher acute toxic effects was less with HF-WBI than with CF-WBI (47% vs 78%; P < .001). Six months after irradiation, physicians reported less fatigue in patients randomized to HF-WBI (0% vs 6%; P = .01), and patients randomized to HF-WBI reported less lack of energy (23% vs 39%; P < .001) and less trouble meeting family needs (3% vs 9%; P = .01). Multivariable regression confirmed the superiority of HF-WBI in terms of patient-reported lack of energy (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.24-0.63) and trouble meeting family needs (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16-0.75). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Treatment with HF-WBI appears to yield lower rates of acute toxic effects than CF-WBI as well as less fatigue and less trouble meeting family needs 6 months after completing radiation therapy. These findings should be communicated to patients as part of shared decision making. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01266642.";0
Novel risk stratification score for predicting early distant brain failure and salvage whole-brain radiotherapy after stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases.;BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate predictors of early distant brain failure (DBF) and salvage whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) after treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases and create a clinically relevant risk score to stratify patients' risk for these events. METHODS: The records of 270 patients with brain metastases who were treated with SRS between 2003 and 2012 were reviewed. Pretreatment patient and tumor characteristics were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses. The cumulative incidences of first DBF and salvage WBRT were calculated. Significant factors were used to create a score for stratifying early (6-month) DBF risk. RESULTS: No prior WBRT, a total lesion volume < 1.3 cm(3), primary breast cancer or malignant melanoma histology, and multiple metastases (>/=2) were found to be significant predictors of early DBF. Each factor was ascribed 1 point because of similar hazard ratios. Scores of 0 to 1, 2, and 3 to 4 were considered to indicate low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively. This correlated with 6-month cumulative incidences of DBF of 16.6%, 28.8%, and 54.4%, respectively (P < .001). For patients without prior WBRT, the 6-month cumulative incidence of salvage WBRT was 2%, 17.7%, and 25.7%, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Early DBF after SRS requiring salvage WBRT remains a significant clinical problem. Patient stratification for early DBF can better inform the decision for the initial treatment strategy for brain metastases. The provided risk score may help to predict early DBF and subsequent salvage WBRT if SRS is initially used. External validation is needed before clinical implementation.;0
The significance of circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer patients undergoing adjuvant or salvage radiation therapy.;"BACKGROUND: Following radical prostatectomy, success of adjuvant and salvage radiation therapy (RT) is dependent on the absence of micrometastatic disease. However, reliable prognostic/predictive factors for determining this are lacking. Therefore, novel biomarkers are needed to assist with clinical decision-making in this setting. Enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) using the regulatory-approved CellSearch System (CSS) is prognostic in metastatic prostate cancer. We hypothesize that CTCs may also be prognostic in the post-prostatectomy setting. METHODS: Patient blood samples (n=55) were processed on the CSS to enumerate CTCs at 0, 6, 12 and 24 months after completion of RT. CTC values were correlated with predictive/prognostic factors and progression-free survival. RESULTS: CTC status (presence/absence) correlated significantly with positive margins (increased likelihood of CTC(neg) disease; P=0.032), and trended toward significance with the presence of seminal vesicle invasion (CTC(pos); P=0.113) and extracapsular extension (CTC(neg); P=0.116). Although there was a trend toward a decreased time to biochemical failure (BCF) in baseline CTC-positive patients (n=9), this trend was not significant (hazard ratio (HR)=0.3505; P=0.166). However, CTC-positive status at any point (n=16) predicted for time to BCF (HR=0.2868; P=0.0437). CONCLUSIONS: One caveat of this study is the small sample size utilized (n=55) and the low number of patients with CTC-positive disease (n=16). However, our results suggest that CTCs may be indicative of disseminated disease and assessment of CTCs during RT may be helpful in clinical decision-making to determine, which patients may benefit from RT versus those who may benefit more from systemic treatments.";0
Dosimetric evaluation of anatomical changes during treatment to identify criteria for adaptive radiotherapy in oesophageal cancer patients.;BACKGROUND: Some oesophageal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and concomitant radiotherapy (chemoRT) show large interfractional anatomical changes during treatment. These changes may modify the dose delivered to the target and organs at risk (OARs). The aim of the presenwt study was to investigate the dosimetric consequences of anatomical changes during treatment to obtain criteria for an adaptive RT decision support system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients were treated with chemoRT for oesophageal and gastro-oesophageal junction cancer and set up according to daily cone beam computed tomography (CBCTs) scans. All patients had an additional replanning CT scan at median fraction number 10 (9-14), which was deformably registered to the original planning CT. Gross tumour volumes (GTVs), clinical target volumes (CTVs) and OARs were transferred to the additional CT and corrected by an exwperienced physician. Treatment plans were recalculated and dose to targets and OARs was evaluated. Treatment was adapted if the volume receiving 95% of the prescribed dose (V95%) coverage of CTV decreased > 1% or planning target volume (PTV) decreased by > 3%. RESULTS: In total, nine adaptive events were observed: All nine were triggered by PTV V95% decrease > 3% [median 11% (5-41%)] and six of these were additionally triggered by CTV V95% decrease > 1% [median 5% (2-35%)]. The largest discrepancies were caused by interfractional baseline or amplitude shifts in diaphragm position (n = 5). Mediastinal (n = 6), oesophageal (n = 6) and bowel filling changes (n = 2) caused the remainder of the changes. For patients with dosimetric changes exceeding the adaptation limits, the discrepancies were confirmed by inspecting the daily CBCTs. In 31% of all patients, heart V30Gy increased more than 2% (maximum 5%). Only minor changes in lung dose or liver dose were seen. CONCLUSION: Target coverage throughout the course of chemoRT treatment is compromised in some patients due to interfractional anatomical changes. Dose to the heart may increase as well.;0
Decision aid on radioactive iodine treatment for early stage papillary thyroid cancer: update to study protocol with follow-up extension.;BACKGROUND: Patient decision aids (P-DAs) are used to inform patients about healthcare choices, but there is limited knowledge about their longer term effects, beyond the time period of decision-making. METHODS/DESIGN: We developed a computerized P-DA that explains the choice of radioactive iodine (RAI) adjuvant treatment or no RAI, for patients with low risk papillary thyroid cancer after total thyroidectomy. The original protocol for a randomized controlled trial, comparing the use of the P-DA (with usual care) to usual care alone, has been published in Trials http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/11/1/81. We found that P-DA (with usual care) significantly improved patients' medical knowledge at the time of decision-making (primary outcome) compared to usual care alone (control). In this update, we present the protocol for an extended follow-up study (15 to 23 months post-randomization), including qualitative and quantitative methods. The patient outcomes evaluated using quantitative questionnaires include: the degree to which patients feel well-informed about their RAI treatment choice, decision satisfaction, decision regret, cancer-related worry, mood, and trust in the treating physician. The qualitative component explores the experiences of RAI treatment decision-making, treatment satisfaction, and trial participation in a representative subgroup of patients. Extended follow-up study results will be described for the entire study population, and data will be compared between the P-DA and control groups. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: This mixed methods extended follow-up study will provide data on long term outcomes, relating to the use of a computerized P-DA in decision-making about adjuvant RAI treatment in early stage papillary thyroid cancer. DISCUSSION: Our results are intended to inform future research in this area, particularly relating to long term effects of the use of P-DAs in making healthcare choices.

Evaluation of S100B in the diagnosis of suspected intracranial hemorrhage after minor head injury in patients who are receiving platelet aggregation inhibitors and in patients 65 years of age and older.;"OBJECT: Cranial CT (CCT) scans and hospital admission are increasingly performed to rule out intracranial hemorrhage in patients after minor head injury (MHI), particularly in older patients and in those receiving antiplatelet therapy. This leads to high radiation exposure and a growing financial burden. The aim of this study was to determine whether the astroglial-derived protein S100B that is released into blood can be used as a reliable negative predictive tool for intracranial bleeding in patients after MHI, when they are older than 65 years or being treated with antiplatelet drugs (low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel). METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective observational study in 2 trauma hospitals. A total of 782 patients with MHI (Glasgow Coma Scale Score 13-15) who were on medication with platelet aggregation inhibitors (PAIs) or were age 65 years and older, independent of antiplatelet therapy, were included. Clinical examination, bloodwork, observation, and CCT were performed in the traumatology emergency departments. When necessary, patients were admitted and observation took place on the ward; in these patients, CCT was performed during their hospital stay. Patients with severe trauma, focal neurological deficits, posttraumatic seizures, anticoagulant therapy, alcohol intoxication, coagulation disorder, blood sampling more than 3 hours after trauma, and unknown time of the trauma were excluded from the study. The median age of the patients was 83 years, and 69% were female. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of S100B with reference to CCT findings were calculated. The cutoff of S100B was set at 0.105 mug/L. RESULTS: Of the 782 patients, 50 (6.4%) had intracranial bleeding. One patient with positive results on CCT scan showed an S100B level below 0.105 mug/L. Of all patients, 33.1% were below the cutoff. S100B showed a sensitivity of 98.0% (CI 89.5%-99.7%), a negative predictive value of 99.6% (CI 97.9%-99.9%), a specificity of 35.3% (CI 31.9%- 38.8%), and a positive predictive value of 9.4% (CI 7.2%-12.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Levels of S100B below 0.105 mug/L can accurately predict normal CCT findings after MHI in older patients and in those treated with PAIs. Combining conventional decision criteria with measurement of S100B can reduce the CCT scan and hospital admission rates by approximately 30%.";0
Prognostic scores for brain metastasis patients: use in clinical practice and trial design.;Brain metastases (BM) are the most serious neurological complication of cancer that results in significant morbidity and mortality in these patients. The most common primary malignancies that lead to BM include lung, breast and melanoma. Until recently the outcomes of patients with BM has been dismal. The current therapeutic options include surgery, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiation (SRS), systemic therapy and symptom management only. Prognostic scores, a useful tool for BM patients, as an estimation of a patient's prognosis can guide tailored treatment for these patients. It is appropriate to recommend more aggressive approaches in patients with good performance status and limited disease and focus on symptom control and palliative measures when the disease is more advanced, or comorbidity preclude aggressive therapy. Due to vastly different outcomes, prognostic scores are important to stratify patients in clinical trials. A number of prognostic scoring systems for BM patients have been proposed that include Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA), the Score Index For Radiosurgery (SIR), the Basic Score for Brain Metastases (BSBM), the Rotterdam system (ROTTERDAM), the Golden Grading System (GGS), 2 Rades classification (RADES), the Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) and the disease specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (ds-GPA). In this article, we will review the important prognostic scoring systems and their utility in clinical decision making and trial design.;0
Operational Testing of a Combined Hardware-Software Strategy for Triage of Radiologically-Contaminated Persons.;"After a radiological dispersal device (RDD) event, it is possible for radionuclides to enter the human body through inhalation, ingestion, and skin and wound absorption. The dominant pathway will be through inhalation. From a health physics perspective, it is important to know the magnitude of the intake to perform dosimetric assessments. From a medical perspective, removal of radionuclides leading to dose (hence risk) aversion is of high importance. The efficacy of medical decorporation strategies is extremely dependent upon the time of treatment delivery after intake. The ""golden hour,"" or more realistically 3-4 h, is imperative when attempting to increase removal of radionuclides from extracellular fluids prior to cellular incorporation. To assist medical first response personnel in making timely decisions regarding appropriate treatment delivery modes, a software tool has been developed which compiles existing radionuclide decorporation therapy data and allows a user to perform simple triage leading to potential appropriate decorporation treatment strategies. Three triage algorithms were included: (1) multi-parameter model (MPM), (2) clinical decision guidance (CDG) model, and (3) annual limit on intake (ALI) model. A radiation triage mask (RTM) has simultaneously been developed to provide a simple and rapid hardware solution for first responders to triage internally exposed personnel in the field. The hardware/software strategy was field tested with a military medical unit and was found by end-users to be relatively simple to learn and use.";0
Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Treatment Options for Single Brain Metastasis.;BACKGROUND: Brain metastases (BMs) occur in up to 30% of patients with cancer. Treatments include surgery, whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), alone or in combination. Although guidelines exist, data to inform individualized approaches to therapy remain sparse. We sought to compare semiquantitatively the effectiveness of various modalities in the treatment of single brain metastasis. METHODS: We performed a comparative effectiveness analysis (CEA) that integrated efficacy, cost, and quality of life (QoL) data for alternate BM treatments. Efficacy data were obtained from a comprehensive review of current literature. Cost estimates were based on publicly available data. QoL data included the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) and other questionnaires. Six treatment strategies using combinations of surgery, WBRT, and SRS were compared with decision tree software. RESULTS: The clinical efficacy, cost, and QoL effects of each strategy were scored semiquantitatively. We constructed a model to integrate individual preferences regarding the relative importance of efficacy, QoL, and cost to provide personalized rankings of the effectiveness of each strategy. CONCLUSION: The choice of strategy must be individualized for patients with a single BM. Our CEA and decision model combines empirical data with patient priorities to produce a ranking of alternate management strategies.;0
New surgical staging system for patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma based on the AJCC/UICC rTNM classification system.;BACKGROUND: Recurrent tumour, node and metastasis (rTNM) stage system does not have an outstanding prognostic value for survival outcome of patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC) and it cannot aid the clinicians to choose the most suitable treatment for these patients. METHODS: In total, 894 rNPC patients were consecutively enroled. All recurrent (r) tumour (T) stages (rT) and node (N) stages (rN) were stratified as resectable and unresectable based on the imaging data of the head and neck. These stages were re-subdivided into surgical T stages (sT) and surgical N stages (sN) with similar clinical characteristics and death risks and were re-integrated into a new 'surgical' stage using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 72.0%, 55.1%, 21.1% and 10.1% in 'surgical' stages I, II, III and IV, respectively (P<0.001). The 'surgical' stage was a significant independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.78, P<0.001) and exhibited enhanced prognostic value compared with the rTNM staging system (area under receiver operating characteristics 0.68 versus 0.63, P<0.001). Endoscopic nasopharyngectomy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy were significant independent positive prognostic factors for the OS of patients with primary lesions in 'surgical' stage I/II and 'surgical' stage III, respectively (P<0.05). A combination of aggressive treatments for loco-regional lesions exhibited a beneficial trend for OS of patients with 'surgical' stage IV (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the rTNM stage system, the 'surgical' staging system exhibited enhanced prognostic value for rNPC patient survival and could aid clinicians in choosing the most suitable treatment for rNPC patients.;0
A review of segmentation and deformable registration methods applied to adaptive cervical cancer radiation therapy treatment planning.;OBJECTIVE: Manual contouring and registration for radiotherapy treatment planning and online adaptation for cervical cancer radiation therapy in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance images (MRI) are often necessary. However manual intervention is time consuming and may suffer from inter or intra-rater variability. In recent years a number of computer-guided automatic or semi-automatic segmentation and registration methods have been proposed. Segmentation and registration in CT and MRI for this purpose is a challenging task due to soft tissue deformation, inter-patient shape and appearance variation and anatomical changes over the course of treatment. The objective of this work is to provide a state-of-the-art review of computer-aided methods developed for adaptive treatment planning and radiation therapy planning for cervical cancer radiation therapy. METHODS: Segmentation and registration methods published with the goal of cervical cancer treatment planning and adaptation have been identified from the literature (PubMed and Google Scholar). A comprehensive description of each method is provided. Similarities and differences of these methods are highlighted and the strengths and weaknesses of these methods are discussed. A discussion about choice of an appropriate method for a given modality is provided. RESULTS: In the reviewed papers a Dice similarity coefficient of around 0.85 along with mean absolute surface distance of 2-4mm for the clinically treated volume were reported for transfer of contours from planning day to the treatment day. CONCLUSIONS: Most segmentation and non-rigid registration methods have been primarily designed for adaptive re-planning for the transfer of contours from planning day to the treatment day. The use of shape priors significantly improved segmentation and registration accuracy compared to other models.;0
Che-1 modulates the decision between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by its binding to p53.;The tumor suppressor p53 is mainly involved in the transcriptional regulation of a large number of growth-arrest- and apoptosis-related genes. However, a clear understanding of which factor/s influences the choice between these two opposing p53-dependent outcomes remains largely elusive. We have previously described that in response to DNA damage, the RNA polymerase II-binding protein Che-1/AATF transcriptionally activates p53. Here, we show that Che-1 binds directly to p53. This interaction essentially occurs in the first hours of DNA damage, whereas it is lost when cells undergo apoptosis in response to posttranscriptional modifications. Moreover, Che-1 sits in a ternary complex with p53 and the oncosuppressor Brca1. Accordingly, our analysis of genome-wide chromatin occupancy by p53 revealed that p53/Che1 interaction results in preferential transactivation of growth arrest p53 target genes over its pro-apoptotic target genes. Notably, exposure of Che-1(+/-) mice to ionizing radiations resulted in enhanced apoptosis of thymocytes, compared with WT mice. These results confirm Che-1 as an important regulator of p53 activity and suggest Che-1 to be a promising yet attractive drug target for cancer therapy.;0
Personalized radiotherapy: concepts, biomarkers and trial design.;In the past decade, and pointing onwards to the immediate future, clinical radiotherapy has undergone considerable developments, essentially including technological advances to sculpt radiation delivery, the demonstration of the benefit of adding concomitant cytotoxic agents to radiotherapy for a range of tumour types and, intriguingly, the increasing integration of targeted therapeutics for biological optimization of radiation effects. Recent molecular and imaging insights into radiobiology will provide a unique opportunity for rational patient treatment, enabling the parallel design of next-generation trials that formally examine the therapeutic outcome of adding targeted drugs to radiation, together with the critically important assessment of radiation volume and dose-limiting treatment toxicities. In considering the use of systemic agents with presumed radiosensitizing activity, this may also include the identification of molecular, metabolic and imaging markers of treatment response and tolerability, and will need particular attention on patient eligibility. In addition to providing an overview of clinical biomarker studies relevant for personalized radiotherapy, this communication will highlight principles in addressing clinical evaluation of combined-modality-targeted therapeutics and radiation. The increasing number of translational studies that bridge large-scale omics sciences with quality-assured phenomics end points-given the imperative development of open-source data repositories to allow investigators the access to the complex data sets-will enable radiation oncology to continue to position itself with the highest level of evidence within existing clinical practice.;0
A Validated Prediction Model for Overall Survival From Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Toward Survival Prediction for Individual Patients.;PURPOSE: Although patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are homogeneous according to the TNM staging system, they form a heterogeneous group, which is reflected in the survival outcome. The increasing amount of information for an individual patient and the growing number of treatment options facilitate personalized treatment, but they also complicate treatment decision making. Decision support systems (DSS), which provide individualized prognostic information, can overcome this but are currently lacking. A DSS for stage III NSCLC requires the development and integration of multiple models. The current study takes the first step in this process by developing and validating a model that can provide physicians with a survival probability for an individual NSCLC patient. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data from 548 patients with stage III NSCLC were available to enable the development of a prediction model, using stratified Cox regression. Variables were selected by using a bootstrap procedure. Performance of the model was expressed as the c statistic, assessed internally and on 2 external data sets (n=174 and n=130). RESULTS: The final multivariate model, stratified for treatment, consisted of age, gender, World Health Organization performance status, overall treatment time, equivalent radiation dose, number of positive lymph node stations, and gross tumor volume. The bootstrapped c statistic was 0.62. The model could identify risk groups in external data sets. Nomograms were constructed to predict an individual patient's survival probability (www.predictcancer.org). The data set can be downloaded at https://www.cancerdata.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.02.048. CONCLUSIONS: The prediction model for overall survival of patients with stage III NSCLC highlights the importance of combining patient, clinical, and treatment variables. Nomograms were developed and validated. This tool could be used as a first building block for a decision support system.;0
Classification and staging of hepatocellular carcinoma: an aid to clinical decision-making.;Classification and staging of hepatocellular carcinoma in a way that allows optimal treatment selection is challenging. This article summarizes some of the classification and staging schemes and discusses the conceptual framework that guides optimal treatment selection for each patient. The article does not exhaustively discuss each staging system proposed in the last three decades, but rather reviews the most commonly used staging systems, evaluates the rationale behind some of the newer staging systems, and compares them focusing on their use in clinical decision-making, notably choice of therapy.;0
30 day mortality in adult palliative radiotherapy--A retrospective population based study of 14,972 treatment episodes.;BACKGROUND: 30-day mortality (30DM) has been suggested as a clinical indicator of the avoidance of harm in palliative radiotherapy within the NHS, but no large-scale population-based studies exist. This large retrospective cohort study aims to investigate the factors that influence 30DM following palliative radiotherapy and consider its value as a clinical indicator. METHODS: All radiotherapy episodes delivered in a large UK cancer centre between January 2004 and April 2011 were analysed. Patterns of palliative radiotherapy, 30DM and the variables affecting 30DM were assessed. The impact of these variables was assessed using logistic regression. RESULTS: 14,972 palliative episodes were analysed. 6334 (42.3%) treatments were delivered to bone metastases, 2356 (15 7%) to the chest for lung cancer and 915 (5.7%) to the brain. Median treatment time was 1day (IQR 1-7). Overall 30DM was 12.3%. Factors having a significant impact upon 30DM were sex, primary diagnosis, treatment site and fractionation schedule (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: This is the first large-scale description of 30-day mortality for unselected adult palliative radiotherapy treatments. The observed differences in early mortality by fractionation support the use of this measure in assessing clinical decision making in palliative radiotherapy and require further study in other centres and health care systems.;0
Undertreatment of Men in Their Seventies with High-risk Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.;BACKGROUND: Many elderly men with high-risk nonmetastatic prostate cancer (HRnMPCa) do not receive radical treatment, despite the high mortality associated with conservative management. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how age and comorbidity affect treatment of men with HRnMPCa. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an observational nationwide register study during 2001-2012. We identified 19 190 men of <80 yr of age diagnosed with HRnMPCa in the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden and 95 948 age-matched men without prostate cancer in the register of the total population. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The outcome was the proportion of men with HRnMPCa receiving radical treatment (radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy). Vital status and the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) were obtained from nationwide registers. The 10-yr survival of men without prostate cancer, stratified by age and CCI, was used as a measure of the life expectancy of the men with prostate cancer. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The proportions receiving radical treatment varied with life expectancy among men younger than 70 yr, whereas use of these treatments did not match the long life expectancy of men in their seventies with CCI 0-1. Only 10% of men aged 75-80 yr with CCI 0 received radical treatment despite 52% probability of 10-yr life expectancy, compared with approximately half of the men younger than 70 yr with a similar life expectancy. The use of radical treatment for HRnMPCa increased with time in all Swedish counties, but a threefold difference between counties remained in 2009-2012 for patients aged 70-80 yr with CCI 0-1. Uncertain external validity is a study limitation, and the impact of physician versus patient preferences on treatment selection could not be assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Otherwise healthy men in their seventies with HRnMPCa were less likely to receive radical treatment than younger men with a similar life expectancy, although increasing use of radical treatment was observed during the study period. Our findings highlight the need for improved methods for clinical decision-making, including improved assessment of life expectancy. PATIENT SUMMARY: We performed a nationwide register study that showed that many healthy men in their seventies live for at least another 10 yr. Despite this long life expectancy, men in their seventies with high-risk nonmetastatic prostate cancer were often not treated with radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, possibly because their life expectancy was underestimated. Our study highlights the need for improved clinical decision-making, which should incorporate an assessment of the patient's life expectancy.;0
Bayesian network models for error detection in radiotherapy plans.;The purpose of this study is to design and develop a probabilistic network for detecting errors in radiotherapy plans for use at the time of initial plan verification. Our group has initiated a multi-pronged approach to reduce these errors. We report on our development of Bayesian models of radiotherapy plans. Bayesian networks consist of joint probability distributions that define the probability of one event, given some set of other known information. Using the networks, we find the probability of obtaining certain radiotherapy parameters, given a set of initial clinical information. A low probability in a propagated network then corresponds to potential errors to be flagged for investigation. To build our networks we first interviewed medical physicists and other domain experts to identify the relevant radiotherapy concepts and their associated interdependencies and to construct a network topology. Next, to populate the network's conditional probability tables, we used the Hugin Expert software to learn parameter distributions from a subset of de-identified data derived from a radiation oncology based clinical information database system. These data represent 4990 unique prescription cases over a 5 year period. Under test case scenarios with approximately 1.5% introduced error rates, network performance produced areas under the ROC curve of 0.88, 0.98, and 0.89 for the lung, brain and female breast cancer error detection networks, respectively. Comparison of the brain network to human experts performance (AUC of 0.90 +/- 0.01) shows the Bayes network model performs better than domain experts under the same test conditions. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of comprehensive probabilistic models as part of decision support systems for improved detection of errors in initial radiotherapy plan verification procedures.;0
The Pocketable Electronic Devices in Radiation Oncology (PEDRO) Project: How the Use of Tools in Medical Decision Making is Changing?;"PURPOSE: To analyze the impact of mobile electronic devices (MEDs) and apps in the daily clinical activity of young radiation or clinical oncologists in 5 Western European countries (Italy, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and Denmark). METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was sent to 462 young (</=40 years) members of the national radiation or clinical oncology associations of the countries involved in the study. The 15 items investigated diffusion of MEDs (smartphones and/or tablets), their impact on daily clinical activity, and the differences perceived by participants along time. RESULTS: A total of 386 (83.5%) of the 462 correctly filled questionnaires were statistically evaluated. Up to 65% of respondents declared to use an electronic device during their clinical activity. Conversely, 72% considered low to moderate impact of smartphones/tables on their daily practice. The daily use significantly increased from 2009 to 2012: users reporting a use >/=6 times/d raised from 5% to 39.9%. Professional needs fulfillment was declared by less than 68% of respondents and compliance to apps indications by 66%. Significant differences were seen among the countries, in particular concerning the feeling of usefulness of MEDs in the daily clinical life. The perception of the need of a comprehensive Web site containing a variety of applications (apps) for clinical use significantly differed among countries in 2009, while it was comparable in 2012. CONCLUSIONS: This survey showed a large diffusion of MEDs in young professionals working in radiation oncology. Looking at these data, it is important to verify the consistency of information found within apps, in order to avoid potential errors eventually detrimental for patients. ""Quality assurance"" criteria should be specifically developed for medical apps and a comprehensive Web site gathering all reliable applications and tools might be useful for daily clinical practice.";0
Using nonrandomized studies to inform complex clinical decisions: the thorny issue of cranial radiation therapy for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.;"BACKGROUND: There are no randomized controlled trials to inform the decision of which cranial radiation therapy (CRT) strategy to apply to pediatric patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURE: We performed a decision analysis using a Markov model in which we compared the life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy when administering one of three CRT strategies to a cohort of patients with T-cell ALL: (1) omission of CRT for all patients; (2) CRT only for those with evidence of leukemic involvement in the central nervous system at diagnosis (therapeutic strategy); or (3) CRT for all (prophylactic strategy). RESULTS: When considering plausible event-free survival rates and late mortality after cure for groups of pediatric patients with T-cell ALL, the strategies of omitting CRT, administering therapeutic CRT, and administering prophylactic CRT result in similar short-term (7-year) survival. When considering the increased contribution of deaths from late effects, the strategy of prophylactic CRT is associated with lower life expectancy when compared to the other two strategies. The Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the strategy of prophylactic CRT was the preferred strategy only 5% of the time. CONCLUSIONS: Similar short-term survival may be expected when comparing the strategies of total omission of CRT, therapeutic CRT, and prophylactic CRT for patients with T-cell ALL. Long-term survival is likely inferior for the strategy of prophylactic CRT. The synthesis of nonrandomized trials and the application of decision analysis can help inform complex decision making in pediatric oncology.";0
A case-control study of treatment choices made by doctors diagnosed with early breast cancer.;INTRODUCTION: Doctors who are diagnosed with breast cancer form a small subset of women with unique insight into their disease. The aim of this study was to compare key treatment decisions in medically-qualified doctors with equivalent degree-educated, matched controls diagnosed with early breast cancer. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with breast cancer between 01/01/2006 and 31/12/2011 were included and screened for occupation by 2 independent investigators. Allied health professionals with a medical background (e.g. nurses, physiotherapists) were excluded. Patient controls were matched by age, nodal status and grade. If there were more than 5 possible matches then those patients with the closest tumour size were selected. RESULTS: 5259 of 8623 patients had signed the generic research consent form. 619 of these were either doctors, or had received tertiary level education and could form appropriate controls. After exclusions, 46 medically-qualified doctors and 230 matched control patients were included in the analysis. No statistical differences in age or tumour characteristics were identified between doctors with breast cancer and matched controls. No differences were identified between the two groups in the uptake of mastectomy, chemotherapy, immediate breast reconstruction or post-mastectomy radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Medically-qualified patients diagnosed with early breast cancer are no more likely to opt for mastectomy, chemotherapy, immediate breast reconstruction or post-mastectomy radiotherapy than non-medically-qualified controls. The level of information generally provided to patients with breast cancer is adequate for a similar decision to be made by control patients with equivalent levels of education, independent of any knowledge of pathology or understanding of the medical system that medically-qualified patients may possess.;0
Effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce the use of imaging for low-back pain: a systematic review.;BACKGROUND: Rates of imaging for low-back pain are high and are associated with increased health care costs and radiation exposure as well as potentially poorer patient outcomes. We conducted a systematic review to investigate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing the use of imaging for low-back pain. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the earliest records to June 23, 2014. We included randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials and interrupted time series studies that assessed interventions designed to reduce the use of imaging in any clinical setting, including primary, emergency and specialist care. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used raw data on imaging rates to calculate summary statistics. Study heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 8500 records were identified through the literature search. Of the 54 potentially eligible studies reviewed in full, 7 were included in our review. Clinical decision support involving a modified referral form in a hospital setting reduced imaging by 36.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 33.2% to 40.5%). Targeted reminders to primary care physicians of appropriate indications for imaging reduced referrals for imaging by 22.5% (95% CI 8.4% to 36.8%). Interventions that used practitioner audits and feedback, practitioner education or guideline dissemination did not significantly reduce imaging rates. Lack of power within some of the included studies resulted in lack of statistical significance despite potentially clinically important effects. INTERPRETATION: Clinical decision support in a hospital setting and targeted reminders to primary care doctors were effective interventions in reducing the use of imaging for low-back pain. These are potentially low-cost interventions that would substantially decrease medical expenditures associated with the management of low-back pain.;0
Evaluating competing and emerging technologies for stereotactic body radiotherapy and other advanced radiotherapy techniques.;Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) refers to the precise irradiation of an image-defined extracranial lesion, using a high total radiation dose delivered in a small number of fractions. A significant proportion of SBRT treatment has been successfully delivered using conventional gantry-based linear accelerators with appropriate image guidance and motion management techniques, although a number of specialist systems are also available. Evaluating the competing SBRT technologies is difficult due to frequent refinements to all major platforms. Comparison of geometric accuracy or treatment planning performance can be hard to interpret and may not provide much useful information. Nevertheless, a general specification overview can provide information that may help radiotherapy providers decide on an appropriate system for their centre. A number of UK randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that better radiotherapy techniques yield better results. RCTs should play an important part in the future evaluation of SBRT, especially where there is a smaller volume of existing data, and where outcomes from conventional radiotherapy are very good. RCT comparison of SBRT with surgery is more difficult due to the radically different treatment arms, although successful recruitment can be possible if the lessons from previous failed trials are learned. The evaluation of new technology poses a number of challenges to the conventional RCT methodology, and there may be situations where it is genuinely not possible, with careful observational studies or decision modelling being more appropriate. Further development in trial design may have an important role in providing clinical evidence in a more timely manner.;0
Institutional review of compliance with NCCN guidelines for breast cancer: lessons learned from real-time multidimensional synoptic reporting.;BACKGROUND: Variations exist in compliance with NCCN Guidelines. Prior reports of adherence to NCCN Guidelines contain limitations because of lack of contemporary review and incomplete listing of reasons for noncompliance. PURPOSE: To assess institutional compliance and assist national quality improvement strategies through identifying valid reasons for noncompliance. METHODS: Compliance with NCCN Guidelines was recorded prospectively using electronic synoptic templates for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer treated at a single institution between January 2010 and December 2011. Compliance with NCCN Guidelines was recorded. The accuracy of real-time synoptic auditing methods compared with retrospective chart review and reasons for noncompliance was assessed. SAS 9.3 software was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Compliance with NCCN Guidelines among 395 patients was 94% for initial staging evaluation, 97% for surgery, 91% for chemotherapy, 89% for hormone therapy, 91% for radiation therapy, 85% for follow-up, and 100% for determination of estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor and HER2 status. Age, comorbidities, and stage influenced guideline compliance. The most common reasons for noncompliance were patient refusal, patient choice after shared decision-making, and overuse of testing. Synoptic templated reporting was accurate in 97% patients. CONCLUSIONS: High compliance with NCCN Guidelines was demonstrated. Reasons for noncompliance were identifiable. Compliance and nonadherence can be evaluated quickly with electronic synoptic reporting. This allows real-time action plans to address quality concerns and aids national risk adjustment for comparison and benchmarking.;0
Validation of a deformable image registration produced by a commercial treatment planning system in head and neck.;In recent years one of the areas of interest in radiotherapy has been adaptive radiation therapy (ART), with the most efficient way of performing ART being the use of deformable image registration (DIR). In this paper we use the distances between points of interest (POIs) in the computed tomography (CT) and the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) acquisition images and the inverse consistence (IC) property to validate the RayStation treatment planning system (TPS) DIR algorithm. This study was divided into two parts: Firstly the distance-accuracy of the TPS DIR algorithm was ascertained by placing POIs on anatomical features in the CT and CBCT images from five head and neck cancer patients. Secondly, a method was developed for studying the implication of these distances on the dose by using the IC. This method compared the dose received by the structures in the CT, and the structures that were quadruply-deformed. The accuracy of the TPS was 1.7 +/- 0.8 mm, and the distance obtained with the quadruply-deformed IC method was 1.7 +/- 0.9 mm, i.e. the difference between the IC method multiplied by two, and that of the TPS validation method, was negligible. Moreover, the IC method shows very little variation in the dose-volume histograms when comparing the original and quadruply-deformed structures. This indicates that this algorithm is useful for planning adaptive radiation treatments using CBCT in head and neck cancer patients, although these variations must be taken into account when making a clinical decision to adapt a treatment plan.;0
Simultaneous beam sampling and aperture shape optimization for SPORT.;PURPOSE: Station parameter optimized radiation therapy (SPORT) was recently proposed to fully utilize the technical capability of emerging digital linear accelerators, in which the station parameters of a delivery system, such as aperture shape and weight, couch position/angle, gantry/collimator angle, can be optimized simultaneously. SPORT promises to deliver remarkable radiation dose distributions in an efficient manner, yet there exists no optimization algorithm for its implementation. The purpose of this work is to develop an algorithm to simultaneously optimize the beam sampling and aperture shapes. METHODS: The authors build a mathematical model with the fundamental station point parameters as the decision variables. To solve the resulting large-scale optimization problem, the authors devise an effective algorithm by integrating three advanced optimization techniques: column generation, subgradient method, and pattern search. Column generation adds the most beneficial stations sequentially until the plan quality improvement saturates and provides a good starting point for the subsequent optimization. It also adds the new stations during the algorithm if beneficial. For each update resulted from column generation, the subgradient method improves the selected stations locally by reshaping the apertures and updating the beam angles toward a descent subgradient direction. The algorithm continues to improve the selected stations locally and globally by a pattern search algorithm to explore the part of search space not reachable by the subgradient method. By combining these three techniques together, all plausible combinations of station parameters are searched efficiently to yield the optimal solution. RESULTS: A SPORT optimization framework with seamlessly integration of three complementary algorithms, column generation, subgradient method, and pattern search, was established. The proposed technique was applied to two previously treated clinical cases: a head and neck and a prostate case. It significantly improved the target conformality and at the same time critical structure sparing compared with conventional intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). In the head and neck case, for example, the average PTV coverage D99% for two PTVs, cord and brainstem max doses, and right parotid gland mean dose were improved, respectively, by about 7%, 37%, 12%, and 16%. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method automatically determines the number of the stations required to generate a satisfactory plan and optimizes simultaneously the involved station parameters, leading to improved quality of the resultant treatment plans as compared with the conventional IMRT plans.;0
Intra thoracic anatomical changes in lung cancer patients during the course of radiotherapy.;"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conebeam-CT (CBCT) guidance is often used for setup verification of lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. The purpose of this study was to quantify intra-thoracic anatomical changes (ITACs) during the radiotherapy treatment and to hand over a decision support system to guide the radiation therapy technologist and radiation oncologist in prioritizing these changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1793 CBCT-scans of 177 lung cancer patients treated in 2010 in our institute with radical radiotherapy were evaluated. Our decision support system: ""the Traffic Light Protocol"", was retrospectively applied to these CBCT-scans. The protocol has four levels: red (immediate action before treatment), orange (action before next fraction), yellow (no action required) and green (no change). RESULTS: In 128 patients (72%), 210 ITACs were observed with a maximum level of red, orange and yellow in 12%, 36% and 24% respectively. Types of observed ITACs were, tumor regression (35%), tumor baseline shift (27%), changes in atelectasis (19%), tumor progression (10%), pleural effusion (6%) and infiltrative changes (3%). CONCLUSIONS: ITACs have been observed in 72% of all lung cancer patients during the course of radical radiotherapy. The clinical relevance of the proposed ITAC classification in lung radiotherapy needs to be validated in a prospective analysis.";0
Minimally invasive palliative procedures in oncology: a review of a multidisciplinary collaboration.;INTRODUCTION: Minimally invasive palliative procedures (MIPPs) are sometimes considered step 4 of the World Health Organization's three-step ladder. A case conference has been created at the BC Cancer Agency to facilitate access to MIPPs for advanced cancer patients with severe pain not responding to conventional analgesics. The twice monthly conference discusses referrals for pain control procedures and reviews imaging, with palliative care, musculoskeletal interventional radiology, radiation oncology, medical oncology, and anesthesia experts in attendance. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study are: first, to determine the benefit to patients from the procedures recommended by the case conference, and second, to explore the impact of the case conference on clinical decision-making. METHODS: A retrospective review of electronic charts of all cancer patients referred to the MIPP case conference between December 20, 2011 and June 25, 2013. RESULTS: There were 103 referrals, resulting in 69 procedures performed among 63 patients. Over 80 % of procedures provided analgesic benefit. Pain scores fell across all categories post-procedure. Mean worst pain scores fell from 8.1 +/- 1.4 to 4.6 +/- 2.8 (P < 0.001). Patient function, mobility, and symptoms measured by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System also improved post-procedure. At time of abstract submission, 37/63 (58.7 %) patients had died, and the mean survival post-procedure was 200 days. The documented rate of major adverse events attributable to MIPPs was 2/69 (2.9 %). CONCLUSIONS: MIPPs are valuable treatment options in patients with severe cancer pain despite use of appropriate step 3 WHO ladder medications. The case conference facilitates excellent communication and sharing of expertise, ensuring optimal patient care.;0
Development of a chemoradiation therapy toxicity staging system for oropharyngeal carcinoma.;OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Develop an innovative tool to standardize representation of treatment toxicity and enable shared decision making by mapping provider-based outcome descriptions to four overall stages of toxicity from chemoradiation therapy for oropharyngeal carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, provider-based questionnaire. METHODS: Five short-term and five long-term treatment outcomes of cisplatin and intensity-modulated radiation therapy for oropharyngeal carcinoma were chosen by a focus group of head and neck oncologists. A pilot survey was developed in an online platform, and feedback from extramural head and neck oncologists was used to refine it for institutional review board submission and formal deployment. Respondents were surgical, radiation, and medical oncologists with experience in treating oropharyngeal carcinoma. One hundred five responses were analyzed, of which 67% were from providers with >10 years in practice and 79% were from providers who treat >15 new oropharyngeal carcinoma patients per year. RESULTS: A particular overall chemoradiation toxicity class is accounted for by two adjoining distress levels (>90% occurrence) for both short-term and long-term outcomes. Providers deemed mucositis and nausea, and pain and xerostomia the most distressing short-term and long-term toxicities, respectively. Providers were split as to their impression of the relative importance that patients place on short-term versus long-term outcomes when considering treatment options. CONCLUSIONS: A clinical tool to represent overall chemoradiation toxicity considering short-term and long-term outcomes has been developed by analyzing provider-centric responses to a realistic clinical scenario. Results from this pilot study enhance patient counseling and shared decision making, and serve as foundational information for a prospective, longitudinal patient-centric observational study.;0
Risk stratification of patients undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy for soft tissue and bone sarcomas.;OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to identify risk factors associated with survival in patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy for soft tissue or bone sarcoma and to create a risk stratification model. METHODS: A retrospective review of the prospectively maintained University of California Los Angeles Sarcoma Database was performed. Clinical, pathologic, and treatment variables were analyzed for overall survival and disease-free survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, and variables that were identified as significant were included to create a risk model. A total of 155 patients who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy for soft tissue sarcoma (n = 108 patients) or bone sarcoma (n = 47 patients) from 1994 to 2010 were identified. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis identified 7 factors associated with poor overall survival: age more than 45 years, disease-free interval less than 1 year, thoracotomy, synchronous disease, location and type of sarcoma (soft tissue vs bone sarcoma), and performance of a lobectomy. The number of factors present was associated with poor overall survival, which varied widely from 64% in patients with 2 factors to 3% in those with 5 factors. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified prognostic variables associated with overall survival after lung metastasectomy. Our model may be used as a risk stratification model to guide treatment decisions on the basis of the number of risk factors present. Although prospective studies are warranted to determine the benefit of surgical intervention in all cohorts compared with other local therapies or medical therapy, given the attendant dismal prognosis in patients with 5 or more risk factors, the benefit of surgical resection in this group is questioned.;0
Emerging science and therapies in non-small-cell lung cancer: targeting the MET pathway.;During this enduring, learner-driven, interactive CME webseries, lung cancer specialists will address the science and targeted therapies for the MET pathway in non-small cell lung cancer. Over the past decade, research has evolved in the science of identifying targeted biological changes in DNA and individual cancer cells. Along with the advanced understanding of lung cancer mutations, has come the development of specific targeted therapies that improve patient outcomes. The first step in treating a patient with lung cancer is proper diagnosis and staging, applying to the principles of personalize medicine. Our current understanding of lung cancer is that of a collection of diseases individualized through specific mutations. This CME activity reviews the role of the pulmonologist and pathologist in proper tissue acquisition and analysis. This new era of personalized medicine and clinical research advances has changed the way clinicians evaluate and treat patients with lung cancer. The data on lung cancer cell mutations and newer targeted therapies have improved the progression free survival and quality of life of lung cancer patients. This CME activity is designed to present a practical overview of recent evidenced based data of MET targeted therapies for patients with lung cancer. As research continues to evolve, we continue to advance our understanding in the science of lung cancers involving the MET pathway. Evidenced based data supporting newer targeted therapeutics provides insight on applying treatment for optimal outcomes. This CME activity will focus on the individualized treatment strategies using practical decision making for patients with MET expression. This activity has been designed to meet the educational needs of medical oncologists, pathologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, pulmonologists, internists, and other healthcare clinicians responsible for the care of patients with lung cancer.

A framework to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the NADiA ProsVue slope to guide adjuvant radiotherapy among men with high-risk characteristics following prostatectomy for prostate cancer.;"OBJECTIVES: The NADiA ProsVue is a prognostic system that measures prostate-specific antigen slope to identify men at lower risk of clinical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. We developed a decision-modeling framework to evaluate its cost-effectiveness to guide the use of adjuvant radiotherapy (ART). METHODS: We populated the model using patient-level data and external sources. Patients were classified as intermediate risk or high risk on the basis of Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment-Postsurgical (CAPRA-S) nomogram and then stratified by the ProsVue slope (</=2 pg/mL/mo; >2 pg/mL/mo) and receipt of ART. In sensitivity analyses, we varied the effect of the ProsVue slope on the use of ART and other model parameters. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of the ProsVue-guided strategy varied widely because of small differences in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at 10 years. In the intermediate-risk group, when the use of ART decreased from 20% (standard care) to 7.5% among patients with a ProsVue slope value of 2 pg/mL/mo or less, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $25,160/QALY. In the high-risk group, the use of ART would have to decrease from 40% (standard care) to 11.5% among those with a ProsVue slope value of 2 pg/mL/mo or less to obtain a ratio of $50,000/QALY. The cost-effectiveness ratios were sensitive to varying benefits of salvage therapy, quality of life, and costs of ART and ProsVue testing. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of the ProsVue system on costs will be dependent on the extent to which ART decreases among men identified as having a low risk of recurrence. Its effect on QALYs will remain conditional on uncertain clinical and quality-of-life benefits associated with ART.";0
Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration for suspected malignancies adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract.;"AIM: To investigate the impact of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in association with a multidisciplinary team evaluation for the detection of gastrointestinal malignancies. METHODS: A cohort of 1019 patients with suspected malignant lesions adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract received EUS-FNA after a standardized multidisciplinary team evaluation (MTE) and were divided into 4 groups according to their specific malignant risk score (MRS). Patients with a MRS of 0 (without detectable risk of malignancy) received only EUS without FNA. For patients with a MRS score ranging from 1 (low risk) - through 2 (intermediate risk) - to 3 (high risk), EUS-FNA cytology of the lesion was planned for a different time and was prioritized for those patients at higher risk for cancer. The accuracy, efficiency and quality assessment for the early detection of patients with potentially curable malignant lesions were evaluated for the whole cohort and in the different classes of MRSs. The time to definitive cytological diagnosis (TDCD), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the rate of inconclusive tests were calculated for all patients and for each MRS group. RESULTS: A total of 1019 patients with suspected malignant lesions were evaluated by EUS-FNA. In 515 patients of 616 with true malignant lesions the tumor was diagnosed by EUS-FNA; 421 patients with resectable lesions received early surgical treatment, and 94 patients received chemo-radiotherapy. The overall diagnostic accuracy for the 1019 lesions in which a final diagnosis was obtained by EUS-FNA was 0.95. When patients were stratified by MTE into 4 classes of MRSs, a higher rate of patients in the group with higher cancer risk (MRS-3) received early treatment and EUS-FNA showed the highest level of accuracy (1.0). TDCD was also shorter in the MRS-3 group. The number of patients who received surgical treatment or chemo-radiotherapy was significantly higher in the MRS-3 patient group (36.3% in MRS-3, 10.7% in MRS-2, and 3.5% in MRS-1). CONCLUSION: EUS-FNA can effectively detect a curable malignant lesions at an earlier time and at a higher rate in patients with a higher cancer risk that were evaluated using MTE.";0
Clinical significance of EpCAM mRNA-positive circulating tumor cells in hepatocellular carcinoma by an optimized negative enrichment and qRT-PCR-based platform.;"PURPOSE: This study aimed to construct a novel platform for the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to investigate the clinical significance of epithelial cell adhesion molecule mRNA-positive (EpCAM(mRNA+)) CTCs using this platform. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An optimized platform for CTC detection was constructed by evaluating different negative enrichment, mRNA isolation, and cDNA synthesis procedures and compared with the CellSearch system. A total of 299 patients with HCC were recruited into this prospective study; of these, 157 who received curative resection, 76 who received transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), and 66 who received radiotherapy were tested using our platform. The diagnostic value of EpCAM(mRNA+) CTCs was investigated in 122 patients with HCC who underwent resection and 120 control subjects. RESULTS: The optimized negative enrichment and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)-based CTC detection platform had high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility and a low sample volume requirement. This platform showed a potential diagnostic value in patients with HCC and exhibited 76.7% consistency with the CellSearch system (r = 0.54, P < 0.050). Pretreatment CTC level showed prognostic significance in patients with HCC treated with resection, TACE, and radiotherapy (all P < 0.050). Most of the patients showed a decrease in CTC levels after treatment that reflected tumor response. In contrast, patients with an increased CTC level showed disease progression after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We established an optimized platform based on negative enrichment and qRT-PCR for highly sensitive, specific, and reproducible CTC detection. This platform might be clinically useful in auxiliary diagnosis, treatment response assessment, and early decision-making to tailor the most effective antitumor strategies.";0
A decision model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) compared to three dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) in patients receiving radiotherapy to the prostate bed.;BACKGROUND: Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a radiation therapy technology that facilitates the delivery of an improved dose distribution with less dose to surrounding critical structures. This study estimates the longer term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of IMRT in patients post radical prostatectomy. METHODS: A Markov decision model was developed to calculate the incremental quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs of IMRT compared with three dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT). Costs were estimated from the perspective of the Australian health care system. RESULTS: IMRT was both more effective and less costly than 3DCRT over 20 years, with an additional 20 QALYs gained and over $1.1 million saved per 1000 patients treated. This result was robust to plausible levels of uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: IMRT was estimated to have a modest long term advantage over 3DCRT in terms of both improved effectiveness and reduced cost. This result was reliant on clinical judgement and interpretation of the existing literature, but provides quantitative guidance on the cost effectiveness of IMRT whilst long term trial evidence is awaited.;0
[Treatment of nonmetastatic prostate cancer: a systematic review of interactive, personalized patient decision aids].;BACKGROUND: Patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer face a complex treatment decision. To support them with personalized information, a variety of interactive computerized decision aids have been developed in Anglo-Saxon countries. Our goal was to identify relevant decision aids and investigate their didactic strengths and limitations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included decision aids that derived individualized content from personal and clinical data provided by the patient. By conducting a systematic literature and internet research through November 2013 supplemented by expert interviews, we identified 10 decision aids of which 6 had been investigated scientifically. We compared their individual characteristics as well as the design and results of the evaluation studies. RESULTS: The decision aids present two to seven therapy choices, whereby radical prostatectomy and percutaneous radiotherapy are always included. Number and type of parameters provided by the patient also vary considerably. Two decision aids derive a therapeutic recommendation from the patient's input. Evaluation studies showed higher disease-related knowledge and greater confidence in the treatment decision after using one of six decision aids. Satisfaction with the decision aid was predominantly high. CONCLUSIONS: Currently personalized patient decision aids for treatment of nonmetastatic prostate cancer are only available in English. These tools can facilitate the shared decision making process for patients and physicians. Therefore, comparable decision aids should be developed in German.;0
Time-dependent estimates of recurrence and survival in colon cancer: clinical decision support system tool development for adjuvant therapy and oncological outcome assessment.;Unanswered questions remain in determining which high-risk node-negative colon cancer (CC) cohorts benefit from adjuvant therapy and how it may differ in an equal access population. Machine-learned Bayesian Belief Networks (ml-BBNs) accurately estimate outcomes in CC, providing clinicians with Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) tools to facilitate treatment planning. We evaluated ml-BBNs ability to estimate survival and recurrence in CC. We performed a retrospective analysis of registry data of patients with CC to train-test-crossvalidate ml-BBNs using the Department of Defense Automated Central Tumor Registry (January 1993 to December 2004). Cases with events or follow-up that passed quality control were stratified into 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival cohorts. ml-BBNs were trained using machine-learning algorithms and k-fold crossvalidation and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis used for validation. BBNs were comprised of 5301 patients and areas under the curve ranged from 0.85 to 0.90. Positive predictive values for recurrence and mortality ranged from 78 to 84 per cent and negative predictive values from 74 to 90 per cent by survival cohort. In the 12-month model alone, 1,132,462,080 unique rule sets allow physicians to predict individual recurrence/mortality estimates. Patients with Stage II (N0M0) CC benefit from chemotherapy at different rates. At one year, all patients older than 73 years of age with T2-4 tumors and abnormal carcinoembryonic antigen levels benefited, whereas at five years, all had relative reduction in mortality with the largest benefit amongst elderly, highest T-stage patients. ml-BBN can readily predict which high-risk patients benefit from adjuvant therapy. CDSS tools yield individualized, clinically relevant estimates of outcomes to assist clinicians in treatment planning.;0
An umbrella protocol for standardized data collection (SDC) in rectal cancer: a prospective uniform naming and procedure convention to support personalized medicine;Predictive models allow treating physicians to deliver tailored treatment moving from prescription by consensus to prescription by numbers. The main features of an umbrella protocol for standardizing data and procedures to create a consistent dataset useful to obtain a trustful analysis for a Decision Support System for rectal cancer are reported.;0
A prospective study comparing the predictions of doctors versus models for treatment outcome of lung cancer patients: a step toward individualized care and shared decision making.;BACKGROUND: Decision Support Systems, based on statistical prediction models, have the potential to change the way medicine is being practiced, but their application is currently hampered by the astonishing lack of impact studies. Showing the theoretical benefit of using these models could stimulate conductance of such studies. In addition, it would pave the way for developing more advanced models, based on genomics, proteomics and imaging information, to further improve the performance of the models. PURPOSE: In this prospective single-center study, previously developed and validated statistical models were used to predict the two-year survival (2yrS), dyspnea (DPN), and dysphagia (DPH) outcomes for lung cancer patients treated with chemo radiation. These predictions were compared to probabilities provided by doctors and guideline-based recommendations currently used. We hypothesized that model predictions would significantly outperform predictions from doctors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experienced radiation oncologists (ROs) predicted all outcomes at two timepoints: (1) after the first consultation of the patient, and (2) after the radiation treatment plan was made. Differences in the performances of doctors and models were assessed using Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis. RESULTS: A total number of 155 patients were included. At timepoint #1 the differences in AUCs between the ROs and the models were 0.15, 0.17, and 0.20 (for 2yrS, DPN, and DPH, respectively), with p-values of 0.02, 0.07, and 0.03. Comparable differences at timepoint #2 were not statistically significant due to the limited number of patients. Comparison to guideline-based recommendations also favored the models. CONCLUSION: The models substantially outperformed ROs' predictions and guideline-based recommendations currently used in clinical practice. Identification of risk groups on the basis of the models facilitates individualized treatment, and should be further investigated in clinical impact studies.;0
Comparative study of staging systems for hepatocellular carcinoma in 428 patients treated with radioembolization.;"PURPOSE: To compare the utility of different staging systems and analyze independent predictors of survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with yttrium-90 ((90)Y) radioembolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the period 2004-2011, 428 patients with HCC were treated with (90)Y radioembolization. All patients were staged prospectively by the following staging systems: Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), United Network for Organ Sharing, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC), Okuda classification, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP), Groupe d'Etude et de Traitement du Carcinome Hepatocellulaire, Chinese University Prognostic Index, and Japan Integrated Staging. The ability of the staging systems to predict survival was assessed. The staging systems were compared using Cox proportional hazards regression model, linear regression, Akaike information criterion (AIC), and concordance index (C-index). Univariate and multivariate analyses were employed to assess independent predictors of survival. RESULTS: When tested independently, all staging systems exhibited significant ability to discriminate early (long survival) from advanced (worse survival) disease. CLIP provided the most accurate information in predicting survival outcomes (AIC = 2,993, C-index = 0.8503); CTP was least informative (AIC = 3,074, C-index = 0.6445). Independent predictors of survival included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status grade 0 (hazard ration [HR], 0.56; confidence interval [CI], 0.34-0.93), noninfiltrative tumors (HR, 0.62; CI, 0.44-0.89), absence of portal venous thrombosis (HR, 0.60; CI, 0.40-0.89), absence of ascites (HR, 0.56; CI, 0.40-0.76), albumin >/= 2.8 g/dL (HR, 0.72; CI, 0.55-0.94), alkaline phosphatase </= 200 U/L (HR, 0.68; CI, 0.50-0.92), and alpha-fetoprotein </= 200 ng/mL (HR, 0.67; CI, 0.51-0.86). CONCLUSIONS: CLIP was most accurate in predicting survival in patients with HCC. Given that not all patients receive the recommended BCLC treatment strategy, this information is relevant for clinical trial design and predicting long-term outcomes after (90)Y radioembolization.";0
Primary tumor volume should be included in the TNM staging system of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.;TNM staging system based on anatomic location, cranial nerve and conventional radiation therapy is currently the widely used classification for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, the T classification in separation of primary tumor volume fail to predict the radiosensitivity of primary tumor. And with the advent of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), increasing studies show the significance of the primary tumor volume on the treatment outcome of NPC patients and primary tumor volume significantly improve the prognostic validity of T classification in NPC. What's more, the current T staging system has limitations to provide appropriate treatment for different subgroup NPC patients. Therefore, we propose that primary tumor volume should be included in the TNM staging system of nasopharyngeal carcinoma to guide our clinical decision.;0
Concept for individualized patient allocation: ReCompare--remote comparison of particle and photon treatment plans.;BACKGROUND: Identifying those patients who have a higher chance to be cured with fewer side effects by particle beam therapy than by state-of-the-art photon therapy is essential to guarantee a fair and sufficient access to specialized radiotherapy. The individualized identification requires initiatives by particle as well as non-particle radiotherapy centers to form networks, to establish procedures for the decision process, and to implement means for the remote exchange of relevant patient information. In this work, we want to contribute a practical concept that addresses these requirements. METHODS: We proposed a concept for individualized patient allocation to photon or particle beam therapy at a non-particle radiotherapy institution that bases on remote treatment plan comparison. We translated this concept into the web-based software tool ReCompare (REmote COMparison of PARticlE and photon treatment plans). RESULTS: We substantiated the feasibility of the proposed concept by demonstrating remote exchange of treatment plans between radiotherapy institutions and the direct comparison of photon and particle treatment plans in photon treatment planning systems. ReCompare worked with several tested standard treatment planning systems, ensured patient data protection, and integrated in the clinical workflow. CONCLUSIONS: Our concept supports non-particle radiotherapy institutions with the patient-specific treatment decision on the optimal irradiation modality by providing expertise from a particle therapy center. The software tool ReCompare may help to improve and standardize this personalized treatment decision. It will be available from our website when proton therapy is operational at our facility.;0
Cost minimization analysis of two treatment regimens for low-risk rhabdomyosarcoma in children: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.;BACKGROUND: Recent Children's Oncology Group trials for low-risk rhabdomyosarcoma attempted to reduce therapy while maintaining excellent outcomes. D9602 delivered 45 weeks of outpatient vincristine and dactinomycin (VA) for patients in Subgroup A. ARST0331 reduced the duration of therapy to 22 weeks but added four doses of cyclophosphamide to VA for patients in Subset 1. Failure-free survival was similar. We undertook a cost minimization comparison to help guide future decision-making. PROCEDURE: Addressing the costs of treatment from the healthcare perspective we modeled a simple decision-analytic model from aggregate clinical trial data. Medical care inputs and probabilities were estimated from trial reports and focused chart review. Costs of radiation, surgery and off-therapy surveillance were excluded. Unit costs were obtained from literature and national reimbursement and inpatient utilization databases and converted to 2012 US dollars. Model uncertainty was assessed with first-order sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Direct medical costs were $46,393 for D9602 and $43,261 for ARST0331 respectively, making ARST0331 the less costly strategy. Dactinomycin contributed the most to D9602 total costs but varied with age (42-69%). Chemotherapy administration costs accounted for the largest proportion of ARST0331 total costs (39-57%). ARST0331 incurred fewer costs than D9602 under most alternative distributive models and alternative clinical practice assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Cost analysis suggests that ARST0331 may incur fewer costs than D9602 from the healthcare system's perspective. Attention to the services driving the costs provides directions for future efficiency improvements. Future studies should prospectively consider the patient and family's perspective.;0
Oral ibandronic acid versus intravenous zoledronic acid in treatment of bone metastases from breast cancer: a randomised, open label, non-inferiority phase 3 trial.;"BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates are routinely used in the treatment of metastatic bone disease from breast cancer to reduce pain and bone destruction. Zoledronic acid given by intravenous infusion has been widely used, but places a substantial logistical burden on both patient and hospital. As a result, the use of oral ibandronic acid has increased, despite the absence of comparative data. In the ZICE trial, we compared oral ibandronic acid with intravenous zoledronic acid for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer to bone. METHODS: This phase 3, open-label, parallel group active-controlled, multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority phase 3 study was done in 99 UK hospitals. Eligibility criteria included at least one radiologically confirmed bone metastasis from a histologically confirmed breast cancer. Patients with ECOG performance status 0 to 2 and clinical decision to treat with bisphosphonates within 3 months of randomisation were randomly assigned to receive 96 weeks of treatment with either intravenous zoledronic acid at 4 mg every 3-4 weeks or oral ibandronic acid 50 mg daily. Randomisation (1:1) was done via a central computerised system within stratified block sizes of four. Randomisation was stratified on whether patients had current or planned treatment with chemotherapy; current or planned treatment with hormone therapy; and whether they had a previous skeletal-related event within the last 3 months or had planned radiotherapy treatment to the bone or planned orthopaedic surgery due to bone metastases. The primary non-inferiority endpoint was the frequency and timing of skeletal-related events over 96 weeks, analysed using a per-protocol analysis. All active (non-withdrawn) patients have now reached the 96-week timepoint and the trial is now in long-term follow-up. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00326820. FINDINGS: Between Jan 13, 2006, and Oct 4, 2010, 705 patients were randomly assigned to receive ibandronic acid and 699 to receive zoledronic acid; three patients withdrew immediately after randomisation. The per-protocol analysis included 654 patients in the ibandronic acid group and 672 in the zoledronic acid group. Annual rates of skeletal-related events were 0.499 (95% CI 0.454-0.549) with ibandronic acid and 0.435 (0.393-0.480) with zoledronic acid; the rate ratio for skeletal-related events was 1.148 (95% CI 0.967-1.362). The upper CI was greater than the margin of non-inferiority of 1.08; therefore, we could not reject the null hypothesis that ibandronic acid was inferior to zoledronic acid. More patients in the zoledronic acid group had renal toxic effects than in the ibandronic acid group (226 [32%] of 697 vs 172 [24%] of 704) but rates of osteonecrosis of the jaw were low in both groups (nine [1%] of 697 vs five [<1%] of 704). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were fatigue (97 [14%] of 697 patients allocated zoledronic acid vs 98 [14%] of 704 allocated ibandronic acid), increased bone pain (91 [corrected] [13%] vs 85 [corrected] [12%]), joint pain (41 [corrected] [6%] vs 38 [5%]), infection (31 [5%] vs 23 [corrected] [3%]), and nausea or vomiting (38 [5%] vs 41 [6%]). INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that zoledronic acid is preferable to ibandronic acid in preventing skeletal-related events caused by bone metastases. However, both drugs have acceptable side-effect profiles and the oral formulation is more convenient, and could still be considered if the patient has a strong preference or if difficulties occur with intravenous infusions.

Multilevel Factors Associated With Overall Mortality for Men Diagnosed With Prostate Cancer in Florida.;To identify individual and contextual factors contributing to overall mortality among men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Florida, a random sample of patients (between October 1, 2001, and December 31, 2007) was taken from the Florida Cancer Data System. Patient's demographic and clinical information were obtained from the Florida Cancer Data System. Comorbidity was computed following the Elixhauser Index method. Census-tract-level socioeconomic status and farm house presence were extracted from Census 2000 and linked to patient data. The ratio of urologists and radiation oncologists to prostate cancer cases at the county level was computed. Multilevel logistic regression was conducted to identify significance of individuals and contextual factors in relation to overall mortality. A total of 18,042 patients were identified, among whom 2,363 died. No racial difference was found in our study. Being older at diagnosis, unmarried, current smoker, uninsured, diagnosed at late stage, with undifferentiated, poorly differentiated, or unknown tumor grade were significantly associated with higher odds of overall mortality. Living in a low-income area was significantly associated with higher odds of mortality (p = .0404). After adjusting for age, stage, and tumor grade, patients who received hormonal, combination of radiation with hormone therapy, and no definitive treatment had higher odds of mortality compared with those who underwent surgery only. A large number of comorbidities were associated with higher odds of mortality. Although disease-specific mortality was not examined, our findings suggest the importance of careful considerations of patient sociodemographic characteristics and their coexisting conditions in treatment decision making, which in turn affects mortality.;0
A proposal for the stratification of the risk of locoregional failure after surgical resection, perioperative high dose rate brachytherapy, and external beam irradiation: the University of Navarre predictive model.;PURPOSE: To develop a simple clinical model predictive of locoregional failure after complete surgical resection followed by perioperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy (PHDRB) and external beam irradiation (EBRT). PATIENT AND METHODS: Patients (n=166) enrolled in several PHDRB prospective studies conducted at the University of Navarre were analyzed. PHDRB was given to total doses of 16 Gy/4 b.i.d. or 24 Gy/6 b.i.d. treatments for negative or close/positive margins along with 45Gy of EBRT. RESULTS: After a median followup of 7.4 years (range, 3-12+), 50 patients have failed and 116 remain controlled at last followup. Tumor size, with a cutoff point set at 3cm (p=0.041) and margin status (positive and <1mm vs. negative >/=1mm, p=0.0001) were independent predictors of locoregional control. These two parameters were used to develop a four-tiered, hierarchical scoring system that stratified patients into low-risk (negative >/=1mm margins and size </=3cm), intermediate-risk (negative >/=1mm margins, and size >3cm), high-risk (positive and <1mm margins and size </=3cm), and very high-risk categories (positive and <1mm margins and size >3cm). This classification yields 5-year locoregional control rates of 92.3%, 78.0%, 65.5%, and 48.0% for low-, intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk categories, respectively. The predictive ability of the model is highly significant (p=0.0001) with an area under the curve of 0.72 (0.64-0.81). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of locoregional failure after combined surgical resection, PHDRB, and EBRT is mainly determined by the number of residual clonogens, which is inversely proportional to the status of the surgical margins and directly related to the size of the resected tumor. These two parameters generate a four-tiered predictive model that seems to be valid for a number of different common tumors and clinical settings.;0
Multicenter, randomized trial of quantitative pretest probability to reduce unnecessary medical radiation exposure in emergency department patients with chest pain and dyspnea.;"BACKGROUND: Use of pretest probability can reduce unnecessary testing. We hypothesize that quantitative pretest probability, linked to evidence-based management strategies, can reduce unnecessary radiation exposure and cost in low-risk patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome and pulmonary embolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a prospective, 4-center, randomized controlled trial of decision support effectiveness. Subjects were adults with chest pain and dyspnea, nondiagnostic ECGs, and no obvious diagnosis. The clinician provided data needed to compute pretest probabilities from a Web-based system. Clinicians randomized to the intervention group received the pretest probability estimates for both acute coronary syndrome and pulmonary embolism and suggested clinical actions designed to lower radiation exposure and cost. The control group received nothing. Patients were followed for 90 days. The primary outcome and sample size of 550 was predicated on a significant reduction in the proportion of healthy patients exposed to >5 mSv chest radiation. A total of 550 patients were randomized, and 541 had complete data. The proportion with >5 mSv to the chest and no significant cardiopulmonary diagnosis within 90 days was reduced from 33% to 25% (P=0.038). The intervention group had significantly lower median chest radiation exposure (0.06 versus 0.34 mSv; P=0.037, Mann-Whitney U test) and lower median costs ($934 versus $1275; P=0.018) for medical care. Adverse events occurred in 16% of controls and 11% in the intervention group (P=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Provision of pretest probability and prescriptive advice reduced radiation exposure and cost of care in low-risk ambulatory patients with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome and pulmonary embolism.

Experts reviews of the multidisciplinary consensus conference colon and rectal cancer 2012: science, opinions and experiences from the experts of surgery.;"The first multidisciplinary consensus conference on colon and rectal cancer was held in December 2012, achieving a majority of consensus for diagnostic and treatment decisions using the Delphi Method. This article will give a critical appraisal of the topics discussed during the meeting and in the consensus document by well-known leaders in surgery that were involved in this multidisciplinary consensus process. Scientific evidence, experience and opinions are collected to support multidisciplinary teams (MDT) with arguments for medical decision-making in diagnosis, staging and treatment strategies for patients with colon or rectal cancer. Surgery is the cornerstone of curative treatment for colon and rectal cancer. Standardizing treatment is an effective instrument to improve outcome of multidisciplinary cancer care for patients with colon and rectal cancer. In this article, a review of the following focuses; Perioperative care, age and colorectal surgery, obstructive colorectal cancer, stenting, surgical anatomical considerations, total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery and training, surgical considerations for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) and local recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC), surgery in stage IV colorectal cancer, definitions of quality of surgery, transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), laparoscopic colon and rectal surgery, preoperative radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy, and how about functional outcome after surgery?";0
The prostate cancer risk stratification (ProCaRS) project: recursive partitioning risk stratification analysis.;Background: The Genitourinary Radiation Oncologists of Canada (GUROC) published a three-group risk stratification (RS) system to assist prostate cancer decision-making in 2001. The objective of this project is to use the ProCaRS database to statistically model the predictive accuracy and clinical utility of a proposed new multi-group RS schema. Methods: The RS analyses utilized the ProCaRS database that consists of 7974 patients from four Canadian institutions. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was utilized to explore the sub-stratification of groups defined by the existing three-group GUROC scheme. 10-fold cross-validated C-indices and the Net Reclassification Index were both used to assess multivariable models and compare the predictive accuracy of existing and proposed RS systems, respectively. Results: The recursive partitioning analysis has suggested that the existing GUROC classification system could be altered to accommodate as many as six separate and statistical unique groups based on differences in BFFS (C-index 0.67 and AUC 0.70). GUROC low-risk patients would be divided into new favorable-low and low-risk groups based on PSA ?6 and PSA >6. GUROC intermediate-risk patients can be subclassified into low-intermediate and high-intermediate groups. GUROC high-intermediate-risk is defined as existing GUROC intermediate-risk with PSA >=10 AND either T2b/c disease or T1T2a disease with Gleason 7. GUROC high-risk patients would be subclassified into an additional extreme-risk group (GUROC high-risk AND (positive cores ?87.5% OR PSA >30). Conclusions: Proposed RS subcategories have been identified by a RPA of the ProCaRS database. ;0
Scoring system for predicting recurrence after chemoradiotherapy including 5-fluorouracil and platinum for patients with esophageal cancer.;BACKGROUND/AIMS: We have retrospectively evaluated clinical data obtained before therapy to enable reliable prediction of recurrence after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for esophageal cancer. METHODOLOGY: We analyzed 108 patients who received 5-fluorouracil and platinum combined with 60 Gy radiation. Of the 108 patients, 42 patients with complete response after CRT were selected for this study. The endpoint was recurrence after CRT. Factors significantly related to recurrence were extracted by the multivariate analysis, and a recurrence score was prepared by combining these factors. RESULTS: The median follow-up interval was 18.5 (2-103) months. Recurrent disease was found in 16 (38.1%) patients. In the univariate analysis, recurrence was associated with nutrition status, family history, dysphagia, location, and length of the tumor. In the multivariate analysis, location of the tumor was selected as a significant factor that contributed independently to recurrence after CRT (p < 0.05). The hazard ratios of the five selected factors was approximated and scored. The cumulative probabilities of tumor recurrence were significantly higher in the high score group than in the low score group (47.5% vs. 12.5% at 6 months, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The recurrence score is suggested to be an appropriate scoring system with which to predict recurrence in patients with esophageal cancer.;0
Medical imaging informatics simulators: a tutorial.;PURPOSE: A medical imaging informatics infrastructure (MIII) platform is an organized method of selecting tools and synthesizing data from HIS/RIS/PACS/ePR systems with the aim of developing an imaging-based diagnosis or treatment system. Evaluation and analysis of these systems can be made more efficient by designing and implementing imaging informatics simulators. This tutorial introduces the MIII platform and provides the definition of treatment/diagnosis systems, while primarily focusing on the development of the related simulators. METHODS: A medical imaging informatics (MII) simulator in this context is defined as a system integration of many selected imaging and data components from the MIII platform and clinical treatment protocols, which can be used to simulate patient workflow and data flow starting from diagnostic procedures to the completion of treatment. In these processes, DICOM and HL-7 standards, IHE workflow profiles, and Web-based tools are emphasized. From the information collected in the database of a specific simulator, evidence-based medicine can be hypothesized to choose and integrate optimal clinical decision support components. Other relevant, selected clinical resources in addition to data and tools from the HIS/RIS/PACS and ePRs platform may also be tailored to develop the simulator. These resources can include image content indexing, 3D rendering with visualization, data grid and cloud computing, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods, specialized image-assisted surgical, and radiation therapy technologies. RESULTS: Five simulators will be discussed in this tutorial. The PACS-ePR simulator with image distribution is the cradle of the other simulators. It supplies the necessary PACS-based ingredients and data security for the development of four other simulators: the data grid simulator for molecular imaging, CAD-PACS, radiation therapy simulator, and image-assisted surgery simulator. The purpose and benefits of each simulator with respect to its clinical relevance are presented. CONCLUSION: The concept, design, and development of these five simulators have been implemented in laboratory settings for education and training. Some of them have been extended to clinical applications in hospital environments.;0
'Rapid Learning health care in oncology' - an approach towards decision support systems enabling customised radiotherapy'.;PURPOSE: An overview of the Rapid Learning methodology, its results, and the potential impact on radiotherapy. MATERIAL AND RESULTS: Rapid Learning methodology is divided into four phases. In the data phase, diverse data are collected about past patients, treatments used, and outcomes. Innovative information technologies that support semantic interoperability enable distributed learning and data sharing without additional burden on health care professionals and without the need for data to leave the hospital. In the knowledge phase, prediction models are developed for new data and treatment outcomes by applying machine learning methods to data. In the application phase, this knowledge is applied in clinical practice via novel decision support systems or via extensions of existing models such as Tumour Control Probability models. In the evaluation phase, the predictability of treatment outcomes allows the new knowledge to be evaluated by comparing predicted and actual outcomes. CONCLUSION: Personalised or tailored cancer therapy ensures not only that patients receive an optimal treatment, but also that the right resources are being used for the right patients. Rapid Learning approaches combined with evidence based medicine are expected to improve the predictability of outcome and radiotherapy is the ideal field to study the value of Rapid Learning. The next step will be to include patient preferences in the decision making.;0
A risk prediction model for determining appropriateness of CEA in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.;"OBJECTIVE: The benefit of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) over medical therapy in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is predicated upon a life expectancy of at least 5 years after the procedure. The goal of this study was to create a scoring system for prediction of 5-year survival after CEA that can be used to triage patients with ACAS. METHODS: All patients who underwent CEA for severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis from 1989 to 2005 were identified. Long-term survival was determined by a review of hospital records and the social security death index. Because all patients had at least 5-year follow-up, a logistic regression of predictors of survival at 5 years was performed and the odds ratios associated with particular significant comorbidities were used to create a scoring system to predict survival. The scoring system was then validated within the cohort using the Hosmer-Lemeshow Test and a derivation/validation receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: There were 2004 CEA performed in 1791 patients. The average follow-up was 130 +/- 49 months. The clinical profile of the cohort data included 84% hypertension, 56% coronary artery disease (CAD), 24% diabetes, and 71% on statins. The 30-day stroke rate was 1.1% and the death rate was 0.7%. The actual 5-year survival was 73%. Logistic regression yielded the following predictors of mortality: age (by decade) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8, P < 0.0001), CAD (OR = 1.5, P = 0.0007), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 2.5; P < 0.0001), diabetes (OR = 1.7, P < 0.0001), neck radiation (OR = 2.6, P = 0.005), no statin (OR = 2.1, P < 0.0001), and creatinine more than 1.5 (OR = 2.6, P < 0.0001). These variables were then assigned a hierarchal point scoring system in accordance with the OR value. The 5-year survival based on the scoring system was as follows: 0 to 5 points = 92.5%, 6 to 8 points = 83.6%, 9 to 11 points = 63.7%, 12 to 14 points = 46.5%, and more than 15 points = 33.8%. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test validated the scoring system (P = 0.26) and there was no difference in the ROC curves (C statistic = 0.74 vs 0.73). CONCLUSIONS: This validated scoring system can be a useful tool for determining which patients are likely to benefit most from CEA based on the probability of long-term survival. Given that the 5-year survival of patients in the medical arm of the asymptomatic CEA trials was 60% to 70%, it is reasonable to conclude that patients who score 0 to 8 points are excellent candidates for CEA whereas most patients with >/=12 points should be managed with medical therapy alone.";0
Are radiation oncologists aware of health literacy among people with cancer treated with radiotherapy?;"Health literacy skills are important for people affected by cancer as they are exposed to complex treatment and follow-up care information. This study aimed to (1) explore radiation oncologists' understandings and awareness of health literacy among patients with a reasonable command of English; (2) gain insight into oncologists' views regarding health literacy; and (3) identify techniques oncologists employ to communicate to different literacy populations. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 radiation oncologists. Four key themes were identified: (1) identifying a patient's literacy level; (2) perceived impact of literacy; (3) challenges and strategies to communicating concepts and supporting decision-making; and (4) suggested improvements to the health system. Participants described subjectively assessing a person's literacy level by monitoring the types of questions asked; analysing the language used; examining non-verbal behaviour, and considering a person's socio-economic situation. Participants reported the challenges of discussing the subtleties of cancer treatments with lower literacy groups such as the benefits and risks of treatment options and clinical trials, and tended to provide the basic facts to facilitate understanding. Radiation oncologists acknowledged the importance of health literacy in oncology, and employed a number of techniques to tailor their communication to different literacy populations. Further research is needed to address the challenges faced by oncologists when interacting with different literacy groups.";0
Clinical similarities: an innovative approach for supporting medical decisions.;Taking decisions in the medical domain is a very complex task. The context is strongly affected by uncertainty and the possible undesired side effects of the treatments have to be carefully considered. Currently, these decisions are based on the physician's own experience and the evidences of the published literature, according, when available, with the philosophy of Evidence Based Medicine. The main issues of this approach are that the own experience can be different, and the results in the literature are sometimes contrasting. For helping physicians while taking medical decisions, we are proposing an innovative approach based on the idea of the clinical similarity. Given a set of clinical variables, the proposed approach selects patients that are similar, presenting to the physician the respective decisions taken and the corresponding clinical effects.;0
Enrollment of patients with lung and colorectal cancers onto clinical trials;"Purpose: Only 2% to 5% of adult patients with cancer enroll onto clinical trials. We assessed simultaneously characteristics of patients and their physicians that may be independently associated with participation. Methods: CanCORS, a National Cancer Institute (NCI) -funded population-based observational cohort study of newly diagnosed patients with lung and colorectal cancers, sampled patients across five geographic areas, five health care delivery systems, and 15 Veterans Administration hospitals. We linked patient survey and medical record data with physician survey data to examine correlates of trial enrollment. Results: Among 9,901 patients, 5.3% enrolled onto trials. Of the 9,901 patients, we linked 6,506 patients to one medical oncologist, surgeon, or radiation oncologist (physicians, N = 1,325) who responded to the physician survey and was considered their primary cancer clinician decision maker. Patient age, race, disease stage, geographic region, and health insurance were independently associated with trial enrollment. Physician factors independently associated with patient trial enrollment were being a medical oncologist, practicing at an NCI-designated cancer center, taking the lead in discussing trials with patients, and receiving increased income from trial enrollment. After simultaneously adjusting for patient and physician characteristics, only being a physician practicing at an NCI-designated cancer center (odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 95% CI, 1.19 to 2.27) and patient female sex (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.68), age > 70 versus < 50 years (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.48), and advanced disease (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.45 to 2.37) remained independently associated with trial enrollment. Conclusion: Both practice environment and patient clinical and demographic characteristics are associated with cancer clinical trial enrollment; simultaneous intervention may be required when trying to increase enrollment rates.";0
Applicability of randomized trials in radiation oncology to standard clinical practice.;"BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are commonly used to inform clinical practice; however, it is unclear how generalizable RCT data are to patients in routine clinical practice. The authors of this report assessed the availability and applicability of randomized evidence guiding medical decisions in a cohort of patients who were evaluated for consideration of definitive management in a radiation oncology clinic. METHODS: The medical records of consecutive, new patient consultations between January and March 2007 were reviewed. Patient medical decisions were classified as those with (Group 1) or without (Group 2) available, relevant level I evidence (phase 3 RCT) supporting recommended treatments. Group 1 medical decisions were further divided into 3 groups based on the extent of fulfilling eligibility criteria for each RCT: Group 1A included decisions that fulfilled all eligibility criteria; Group 1B, decisions that did not fulfill at least 1 minor eligibility criteria; or Group 1C, decisions that did not fulfill at least 1 major eligibility criteria. Patient and clinical characteristics were tested for correlations with the availability of evidence. RESULTS: Of the 393 evaluable patients, malignancies of the breast (30%), head and neck (18%), and genitourinary system (14%) were the most common presenting primary disease sites. Forty-seven percent of all medical decisions (n = 451) were made without available (36%) or applicable (11%) randomized evidence to inform clinical decision making. Primary tumor diagnosis was significantly associated with the availability of evidence (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of medical decisions in an academic radiation oncology clinic were made without available or applicable level I evidence, underscoring the limitations of relying solely on RCTs for the development of evidence-based health care.";0
Real-time tumor tracking in the lung using an electromagnetic tracking system.;"PURPOSE: To describe the first use of the commercially available Calypso 4D Localization System in the lung. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Under an institutional review board-approved protocol and an investigational device exemption from the US Food and Drug Administration, the Calypso system was used with nonclinical methods to acquire real-time 4-dimensional lung tumor tracks for 7 lung cancer patients. The aims of the study were to investigate (1) the potential for bronchoscopic implantation; (2) the stability of smooth-surface beacon transponders (transponders) after implantation; and (3) the ability to acquire tracking information within the lung. Electromagnetic tracking was not used for any clinical decision making and could only be performed before any radiation delivery in a research setting. All motion tracks for each patient were reviewed, and values of the average displacement, amplitude of motion, period, and associated correlation to a sinusoidal model (R(2)) were tabulated for all 42 tracks. RESULTS: For all 7 patients at least 1 transponder was successfully implanted. To assist in securing the transponder at the tumor site, it was necessary to implant a secondary fiducial for most transponders owing to the transponder's smooth surface. For 3 patients, insertion into the lung proved difficult, with only 1 transponder remaining fixed during implantation. One patient developed a pneumothorax after implantation of the secondary fiducial. Once implanted, 13 of 14 transponders remained stable within the lung and were successfully tracked with the tracking system. CONCLUSIONS: Our initial experience with electromagnetic guidance within the lung demonstrates that transponder implantation and tracking is achievable though not clinically available. This research investigation proved that lung tumor motion exhibits large variations from fraction to fraction within a single patient and that improvements to both transponder and tracking system are still necessary to create a clinical daily-use system to assist with actual lung radiation therapy.";0
Optimal management of gastric cancer: results from an international RAND/UCLA expert panel.;"OBJECTIVE: Defining processes of care, which are appropriate and necessary for management of gastric cancer (GC), is an important step toward improving outcomes. METHODS: Using a RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method, an international multidisciplinary expert panel created 22 statements reflecting optimal management. All statements were scored for appropriateness and necessity. RESULTS: The following tenets were scored appropriate and necessary: (1) preoperative staging by computed tomography of abdomen/pelvis; (2) positron-emission tomographic scans not routinely indicated; (3) consideration for adjuvant therapy; (4) further clinical trials; (5) multidisciplinary decision making; (6) sufficient support at hospitals; (7) assessment of 16 or more lymph nodes (LNs); (8) in metastatic disease, surgery only for palliation of major symptoms; (9) surgeons experienced in GC management; (10) and surgeons experienced in both GC management and advanced laparoscopic surgery for laparoscopic resection. The following were scored appropriate, but of indeterminate necessity: (1) diagnostic laparoscopy before treatment; (2) a multidisciplinary approach to linitis plastica; (3) genetic assessment for diffuse GC and family history, or age less than 45 years; (4) endoscopic removal of select T1aN0 lesions; (5) D2 LN dissection in curative intent cases; (6) D1 LN dissection for early GC or patients with comorbidities; (7) frozen section analysis of margins; (8) nonemergent cases performed in a hospital with a volume of more than 15 resections per year; and (9) by a surgeon with more than 6 resection per year. CONCLUSIONS: The expert panel has created 22 statements for the perioperative management of GC patients, to provide guidance to clinicians and improve the care received by patients.";0
Accuracy and sources of error of out-of field dose calculations by a commercial treatment planning system for intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatments.;Although treatment planning systems are generally thought to have poor accuracy for out-of-field dose calculations, little work has been done to quantify this dose calculation inaccuracy for modern treatment techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), or to understand the sources of this inaccuracy. The aim of this work is to evaluate the accuracy of out-of-field dose calculations by a commercial treatment planning system (TPS), Pinnacle3 v.9.0, for IMRT treatment plans. Three IMRT plans were delivered to anthropomorphic phantoms, and out-of-field doses were measured using thermoluminescent detectors (TLDs). The TLD-measured dose was then compared to the TPS-calculated dose to quantify the accuracy of TPS calculations at various distances from the field edge and out-of-field anatomical locations of interest (i.e., radiosensitive organs). The individual components of out-of-field dose (patient scatter, collimator scatter, and head leakage) were also calculated in Pinnacle and compared to Monte Carlo simulations for a 10 x 10 cm2 field. Our results show that the treatment planning system generally underestimated the out-of-field dose and that this underestimation worsened (accuracy decreased) for increasing distances from the field edge. For the three IMRT treatment plans investigated, the TPS underestimated the dose by an average of 50%. Our results also showed that collimator scatter was underestimated by the TPS near the treatment field, while all components of out-of-field dose were severely underestimated at greater distances from the field edge. This study highlights the limitations of commercial treatment planning systems in calculating out-of-field dose and provides data about the level of accuracy, or rather inaccuracy, that can be expected for modern IMRT treatments. Based on our results, use of the TPS-reported dose could lead to an underestimation of secondary cancer induction risk, as well as poor clinical decision-making for pregnant patients or patients with implantable cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators.;0
Research opportunities in intraoperative radiation therapy: the next decade 2013-2023.;"The reality of intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) practice is consistent with an efficient and highly precise radiation therapy technique to safely boost areas at risk for local recurrence. Long-term clinical experience has shown that IORT-containing multi-modality regimens appear to improve local disease control, if not survival in many diseases. Research with IORT is a multidisciplinary scenario that covers knowledge from radiation beam adapted development to advance molecular biology for bio-predictability of outcome. The technical parameters employed in IORT procedures are important information to be recorded for quality assurance and clinical results analysis. In addition, specific treatment planning systems for IORT procedures are available, to help in the treatment decision-making process. A systematic revision of opportunities for research and innovation in IORT is reported including radiation beam modulation, delivery, dosimetry and planning; infrastructure and treatment factors; experimental and clinical radiobiology; clinical trials, innovation and translational research development.";0
The development of a standardized software platform to support provincial population-based cancer outcomes units for multiple tumour sites: OaSIS - Outcomes and Surveillance Integration System.;Understanding the impact of treatment policies on patient outcomes is essential in improving all aspects of patient care. The BC Cancer Agency is a provincial program that provides cancer care on a population basis for 4.5 million residents. The Lung and Head & Neck Tumour Groups planned to create a generic yet comprehensive software infrastructure that could be used by all Tumour Groups: the Outcomes and Surveillance Integration System (OaSIS). The primary goal was the development of an integrated database that will amalgamate existing provincial data warehouses of varying datasets and provide the infrastructure to support additional routes of data entry, including clinicians from multiple-disciplines, quality of life and survivorship data from patients, and three dimensional dosimetric information archived from the radiotherapy planning and delivery systems. The primary goal is to be able to capture any data point related to patient characteristics, disease factors, treatment details and survivorship, from the point of diagnosis onwards. Through existing and novel data-mining techniques, OaSIS will support unique population based research activities by promoting collaborative interactions between the research centre, clinical activities at the cancer treatment centres and other institutions. This will also facilitate initiatives to improve patient outcomes, decision support in achieving operational efficiencies and an environment that supports knowledge generation.;0
Novel prognostic scoring system after surgery for Klatskin tumor;"Klatskin tumor is a rare hepatobiliary malignancy whose outcome and prognostic factors are not clearly documented. Between April 1998 and January 2007, 96 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma underwent resection. Data were collected prospectively. Thirty-one variables were evaluated for prognostic significance. There were 40 trisectionectomies, 40 hemihepatectomies, five central hepatectomies, and 11 biliary hilar resections. Thirty-seven (n = 37) patients required vascular reconstruction. There were 68 R0, 26 R1, and two R2 resections. Age (P = 0.048), pT status (P = 0.046), R class (P = 0.034), and adjuvant chemoradiation (P = 0.045) showed predictive significance by multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. A point scoring system was determined as follows: age younger than 62 years:age 62 years or older = 1:2 points; pT1:pT2 to 4 = 1:2 points; R0:R1/2 = 1:2 points; and chemoradiation yes:no = 1:2 points. The only model that reached statistical significance (P = 0.0332) described the following three groups: score 6 or less; score = 7; and score = 8. Median survival for score 6 or less, score = 7, and score = 8 was 26.5, 12, and 2.2 months, respectively (P = 0.032). The corresponding 1- and 3-year survival rates were 73 to 56 per cent, 52 to 38 per cent, and 17 to 0 per cent, respectively. We propose a scoring system predictive of long-term surgical outcome that could potentially improve patient selection for further postoperative oncologic treatment for Klatskin tumors.";0
How does PET/CT help in selecting therapy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma?;Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has emerged as the most accurate tool for staging, treatment monitoring, and response evaluation in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Accurate staging and restaging are very important for the optimal management of HL, but we are only beginning to understand how to use PET/CT to improve treatment outcome. More precise determination of disease extent may result in more precise pretreatment risk stratification, and is also essential for the minimal and highly individualized radiotherapy volumes of the present era. Several trials are currently investigating the use of PET/CT for early response-adapted therapy, with therapeutic stratification based on interim PET/CT results. Posttreatment PET/CT is a cornerstone of the revised response criteria and enables the selection of advanced-stage patients without the need for consolidation radiotherapy. Once remission is achieved after first-line therapy, PET/CT seems to have little or no role in the routine surveillance of HL patients. PET/CT looks promising for the selection of therapy in relapsed and refractory disease, but its role in this setting is still unclear.;0
Predicting outcomes in radiation oncology--multifactorial decision support systems.;With the emergence of individualized medicine and the increasing amount and complexity of available medical data, a growing need exists for the development of clinical decision-support systems based on prediction models of treatment outcome. In radiation oncology, these models combine both predictive and prognostic data factors from clinical, imaging, molecular and other sources to achieve the highest accuracy to predict tumour response and follow-up event rates. In this Review, we provide an overview of the factors that are correlated with outcome-including survival, recurrence patterns and toxicity-in radiation oncology and discuss the methodology behind the development of prediction models, which is a multistage process. Even after initial development and clinical introduction, a truly useful predictive model will be continuously re-evaluated on different patient datasets from different regions to ensure its population-specific strength. In the future, validated decision-support systems will be fully integrated in the clinic, with data and knowledge being shared in a standardized, instant and global manner.;0
[Database supported electronic retrospective analyses in radiation oncology: establishing a workflow using the example of pancreatic cancer].;PURPOSE: Especially in the field of radiation oncology, handling a large variety of voluminous datasets from various information systems in different documentation styles efficiently is crucial for patient care and research. To date, conducting retrospective clinical analyses is rather difficult and time consuming. With the example of patients with pancreatic cancer treated with radio-chemotherapy, we performed a therapy evaluation by using an analysis system connected with a documentation system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total number of 783 patients have been documented into a professional, database-based documentation system. Information about radiation therapy, diagnostic images and dose distributions have been imported into the web-based system. RESULTS: For 36 patients with disease progression after neoadjuvant chemoradiation, we designed and established an analysis workflow. After an automatic registration of the radiation plans with the follow-up images, the recurrence volumes are segmented manually. Based on these volumes the DVH (dose volume histogram) statistic is calculated, followed by the determination of the dose applied to the region of recurrence. All results are saved in the database and included in statistical calculations. CONCLUSION: The main goal of using an automatic analysis tool is to reduce time and effort conducting clinical analyses, especially with large patient groups. We showed a first approach and use of some existing tools, however manual interaction is still necessary. Further steps need to be taken to enhance automation. Already, it has become apparent that the benefits of digital data management and analysis lie in the central storage of data and reusability of the results. Therefore, we intend to adapt the analysis system to other types of tumors in radiation oncology.;0
Dose prescription in carbon ion radiotherapy: a planning study to compare NIRS and LEM approaches with a clinically-oriented strategy.;"In carbon ion radiotherapy there is an urgent clinical need to develop objective tools for the conversion of relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted doses based on different models. In this work we introduce a clinically oriented method to compare NIRS-based and LEM-based GyE systems, minimizing differences in physical dose distributions between treatment plans. Carbon ion plans were optimized on target volumes of cubic and spherical shapes, for RBE-weighted dose prescription levels ranging from 3.6 to 4.4 GyE. Plans were calculated for target sizes from 4 to 12 cm defining three beam geometries: single beam, opposed beam and orthogonal beam configurations. The two treatment planning systems currently employed in clinical practice were used, providing the NIRS-based and LEM-based GyE calculations. Physical dose distributions of NIRS-based and LEM-based treatment plans were compared. LEM-based prescription doses that minimize differences in physical dose distributions between the two systems were found. These doses were compared with the mean RBE-weighted dose obtained with a Monte Carlo code (FLUKA) interfaced with LEM I. In the investigated dose range, LEM-based RBE-weighted prescription doses, that minimize differences with NIRS plans, should be higher than NIRS reported prescription doses. The optimal dose depends on target size, shape and position, number of beams and dose level. The opposed beam configuration resulted in the smallest average prescription dose difference (0.45 +/- 0.09 GyE). The second approach of recalculating NIRS RBE-weighted dose with a Monte Carlo code interfaced with LEM resulted in no significant difference with the results obtained from the planning study. The delivery of a voxel by voxel iso-effective plan, if different RBE models are employed, is not feasible; it is however possible to minimize differences in a treatment plan with the simple approach presented here. Dose prescription ultimately represents a clinical task under the responsibility of the radiation oncologist, the presented analysis intends to be a quantitative and objective way to assist the clinical decision.";0
How do surgeons decide to refer patients for adjuvant cancer treatment? Protocol for a qualitative study.;BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer are commonly diagnosed cancers in Canada. Patients diagnosed with early-stage non-small cell lung, breast, or colorectal cancer represent potentially curable populations. For these patients, surgery is the primary mode of treatment, with (neo)adjuvant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy) recommended according to disease stage. Data from our research in Nova Scotia, as well as others', demonstrate that a substantial proportion of non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer patients, for whom practice guidelines recommend (neo)adjuvant therapy, are not referred for an oncologist consultation. Conversely, surveillance data and clinical experience suggest that breast cancer patients have much higher referral rates. Since surgery is the primary treatment, the surgeon plays a major role in referring patients to oncologists. Thus, an improved understanding of how surgeons make decisions related to oncology services is important to developing strategies to optimize referral rates. Few studies have examined decision making for (neo)adjuvant therapy from the perspective of the cancer surgeon. This study will use qualitative methods to examine decision-making processes related to referral to oncology services for individuals diagnosed with potentially curable non-small cell lung, breast, or colorectal cancer. METHODS: A qualitative study will be conducted, guided by the principles of grounded theory. The study design is informed by our ongoing research, as well as a model of access to health services. The method of data collection will be in-depth, semi structured interviews. We will attempt to recruit all lung, breast, and/or colorectal cancer surgeons in Nova Scotia (n  approximately  42), with the aim of interviewing a minimum of 34 surgeons. Interviews will be audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Data will be collected and analyzed concurrently, with two investigators independently coding and analyzing the data. Analysis will involve an inductive, grounded approach using constant comparative analysis. DISCUSSION: The primary outcomes will be (1) identification of the patient, surgeon, institutional, and health-system factors that influence surgeons' decisions to refer non-small cell lung, breast, and colorectal cancer patients to oncology services when consideration for (neo)adjuvant therapy is recommended and (2) identification of potential strategies that could optimize referral to oncology for appropriate individuals.;0
Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.;CONTEXT: The Gleason grading system is one of the most powerful predictors of outcome in prostate cancer and a cornerstone in counseling and treating patients. Since its inception, it has undergone several modifications triggered by a change in clinical practice and a better understanding of the cancer's histologic spectrum and variants and their prognostic significance. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the implementation and the impact of the Gleason system as a predictive and prognostic tool in all available treatment modalities, and to compare the original and modified Gleason systems in major pathologic and clinical outcome data sets. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A comprehensive nonsystematic Medline search was performed using multiple Medical Subject Headings such as Gleason, modified, system, outcome, biopsy, prostatectomy, recurrence, prognosis, radiotherapy, and focal therapy, with restriction to the English language and a preference for publications within the last 10 yr. All Gleason grade-related studies in the last 3 yr were reviewed. For studies before this date, we relied on prior culling of the literature for various recent books, chapters, and original articles on this topic. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Using the modified grading system resulted in disease upgrading with more cancers assigned a Gleason score >/= 7 than in the past. It also resulted in a more homogeneous Gleason score 6, which has an excellent prognosis when the disease is organ confined. The vast majority of studies using both systems showed that Gleason grading of adenocarcinomas on needle biopsies and radical prostatectomies was strongly associated with pathologic stage, status of surgical margins, metastatic disease, biochemical recurrence, and cancer-specific survival, with the modified system outperforming the original one in some large series. A description of the continuous incorporation of this parameter in the clinical decision making for treating prostate cancer using all currently used treatment modalities is presented, and the findings of studies before and after the inception of the modified grading system, if available, are compared. The proposed contemporary grading prognostic categories are 3+3, 3+4, 4+3, 8, and 9-10. CONCLUSIONS: The Gleason score is one of the most critical predictive factors of prostate cancer regardless of the therapy used. Modernization of the Gleason grading system has resulted in a more accurate grading system for radical prostatectomy (RP) but has complicated the comparison of data before and after the updating. A better prognostication with the updated Gleason grading system for patients treated with modalities other than surgery can only be postulated at this time because there are limited conflicting data on radiation and no studies on other treatment modalities. Its greatest impact is the uniformly excellent prognosis associated with Gleason score 6 in RPs.;0
Role of multidetector computed tomography in the diagnosis and management of patients attending the rapid access chest pain clinic, The Scottish computed tomography of the heart (SCOT-HEART) trial: study protocol for randomized controlled trial.;BACKGROUND: Rapid access chest pain clinics have facilitated the early diagnosis and treatment of patients with coronary heart disease and angina. Despite this important service provision, coronary heart disease continues to be under-diagnosed and many patients are left untreated and at risk. Recent advances in imaging technology have now led to the widespread use of noninvasive computed tomography, which can be used to measure coronary artery calcium scores and perform coronary angiography in one examination. However, this technology has not been robustly evaluated in its application to the clinic. METHODS/DESIGN: The SCOT-HEART study is an open parallel group prospective multicentre randomized controlled trial of 4,138 patients attending the rapid access chest pain clinic for evaluation of suspected cardiac chest pain. Following clinical consultation, participants will be approached and randomized 1:1 to receive standard care or standard care plus >/=64-multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography and coronary calcium score. Randomization will be conducted using a web-based system to ensure allocation concealment and will incorporate minimization. The primary endpoint of the study will be the proportion of patients diagnosed with angina pectoris secondary to coronary heart disease at 6 weeks. Secondary endpoints will include the assessment of subsequent symptoms, diagnosis, investigation and treatment. In addition, long-term health outcomes, safety endpoints, such as radiation dose, and health economic endpoints will be assessed. Assuming a clinic rate of 27.0% for the diagnosis of angina pectoris due to coronary heart disease, we will need to recruit 2,069 patients per group to detect an absolute increase of 4.0% in the rate of diagnosis at 80% power and a two-sided P value of 0.05. The SCOT-HEART study is currently recruiting participants and expects to report in 2014. DISCUSSION: This is the first study to look at the implementation of computed tomography in the patient care pathway that is outcome focused. This study will have major implications for the management of patients with cardiovascular disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01149590.;0
Personal preferences and discordant prostate cancer treatment choice in an intervention trial of men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer.;"BACKGROUND: Men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (LPC) can choose from multiple treatment regimens and are faced with a decision in which medical factors and personal preferences are important. The Personal Patient Profile-Prostate (P3P) is a computerized decision aid for men with LPC that focuses on personal preferences. We determined whether the P3P intervention improved the concordance of treatment choice with self-reported influential side-effects compared with a control group. METHODS: English/Spanish-speaking men diagnosed with LPC (2007-2009) from four US cities were enrolled into a randomized trial and followed through 6-months via mailed or online questionnaire. Men were randomized to receive the P3P intervention or standard education plus links to reputable websites. We classified choice as concordant if men were concerned with (a) sexual function and chose external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy, (b) bowel function and chose prostatectomy, (c) sex, bowel, and/or bladder function and chose active surveillance, or (d) not concerned with any side effect and chose any treatment. Using logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between the P3P intervention and concordance. RESULTS: Of 448 men, most were <65 years, non-Hispanic white, had multiple physician consultations prior to enrollment, and chose a treatment discordant with concerns about potential side effects. There was no significant difference in concordance between the intervention (45%) and control (50%) group (OR = 0.82; 95%CI = 0.56, 1.2). CONCLUSIONS: The P3P intervention did not improve concordance between potential side effects and treatment choice. Information and/or physician consultation immediately after diagnosis was likely to influence decisions despite concerns about side effects. The intervention may be more effective before the first treatment options consultation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00692653 http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00692653.";0
Technical note: electronic chart checks in a paperless radiation therapy clinic.;PURPOSE: EcCk, which stands for Electronic Chart ChecK, is a computer software and database system. It was developed to improve quality and efficiency of patient chart checking in radiation oncology departments. The core concept is to automatically collect and analyze patient treatment data, and to report discrepancies and potential concerns. METHODS: EcCk consists of several different computer technologies, including relational database, DICOM, dynamic HTML, and image processing. Implemented in MATLAB and C#, EcCk processes patient data in DICOM, PDF, Microsoft Word, database, and Pinnacle native formats. Generated reports are stored on the storage server and indexed in the database. A standalone report-browser program is implemented to allow users to view reports on any computer in the department. Checks are performed according to predefined logical rules, and results are presented through color-coded reports in which discrepancies are summarized and highlighted. Users examine the reports and take appropriate actions. The core design is intended to automate human task and to improve the reliability of the performed tasks. The software is not intended to replace human audits but rather to aid as a decision support tool. RESULTS: The software was successfully implemented in the clinical environment and has demonstrated the feasibility of automation of this common task with modern clinical tools. The software integrates multiple disconnected systems and successfully supports analysis of data in diverse formats. CONCLUSIONS: While the human is the ultimate expert, EcCk has a significant potential to improve quality and efficiency of patient treatment record audits, and to allow verification of tasks that are not easily performed by humans. EcCk can potentially relieve human experts from simple and repetitive tasks, and allow them to work on other important tasks, and in the end to improve the quality and safety of radiation therapy treatments.;0
Great expectations: use of molecular tests and computerised prognostic tools in New Zealand cancer care.;BACKGROUND: Use of molecular tests and computerised prognostic tools designed to individualise cancer care appears to be rapidly increasing in New Zealand. These tests have important clinical and health economic implications, but their impact on cancer care has not been fully assessed. AIM: To determine cancer clinicians' use of and expectations for molecular tests and computerised prognostic tools. METHOD: Online survey of clinicians managing cancer in New Zealand. RESULTS: 137 clinicians participated, 31% used molecular tests and 57% used computerised prognostic tools. These technologies affected clinical decisions made by a quarter of participants. Over 85% of participants believed that the impact of molecular tests and computerised prognostic tools would increase over the next decade and that a stronger evidence base would support their use. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular tests and computerised prognostic tools already influence treatment provided to many New Zealand cancer patients. Clinicians who participated in this survey overwhelmingly expect the use of these tests to increase, which has important clinical implications since there is little high quality prospective data assessing the ability of these tests to improve patient outcomes. Expanded use of these often-expensive tests also has economic implications. The role of these technologies needs to be considered in the context of a wide-ranging cancer control strategy.;0
A percutaneous treatment algorithm for crossing coronary chronic total occlusions;"Coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs) are frequently identified during coronary angiography and remain the most challenging lesion group to treat. Patients with CTOs are frequently left unrevascularized due to perceptions of high failure rates and technical complexity even if they have symptoms of coronary disease or ischemia. In this review, the authors describe a North American contemporary approach for percutaneous coronary interventions for CTO. Two guide catheters are placed to facilitate seamless transition between antegrade wire-based, antegrade dissection re-entry-based, and retrograde (wire or dissection re-entry) techniques, the ""hybrid"" interventional strategy. After dual coronary injection is performed, 4 angiographic parameters are assessed: 1) clear understanding of location of the proximal cap using angiography or intravascular ultrasonography; 2) lesion length; 3) presence of branches, as well as size and quality of the target vessel at the distal cap; and 4) suitability of collaterals for retrograde techniques. On the basis of these 4 characteristics, an initial strategy and rank order hierarchy for technical approaches is established. Radiation exposure, contrast utilization, and procedure time are monitored throughout the procedure, and thresholds are established for intraprocedural strategy conversion to maximize safety, efficiency, and effectiveness.";0
Credentialing of radiotherapy centres for a clinical trial of adaptive radiotherapy for bladder cancer (TROG 10.01).;"BACKGROUND: Daily variations in bladder filling make conformal treatment of bladder cancer challenging. On-line adaptive radiotherapy with a choice of plans has been demonstrated to reduce small bowel irradiation in single institution trials. In order to support a multicentre feasibility clinical trial on adaptive radiotherapy for bladder cancer (TROG 10.01) a credentialing programme was developed for centres wishing to participate. METHODS: The credentialing programme entails three components: a facility questionnaire; a planning exercise which tests the ability of centres to create three adaptive plans based on a planning and five cone beam CTs; and a site visit during which image quality, imaging dose and image guidance procedures are assessed. Image quality and decision making were tested using customised inserts for a Perspex phantom (Modus QUASAR) that mimic different bladder sizes. Dose was assessed in the same phantom using thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD). RESULTS: All 12 centres participating in the full credentialing programme were able to generate appropriate target volumes in the planning exercise and identify the correct target volume and position the bladder phantom in the phantom within 3mm accuracy. None of the imaging doses exceeded the limit of 5 cGy with a CT on rails system having the lowest overall dose. CONCLUSION: A phantom mimicking the decision making process for adaptive radiotherapy was found to be well suited during site visits for credentialing of centres participating in a clinical trial of adaptive radiotherapy for bladder cancer. Combined with a planning exercise the site visit allowed testing the ability of centres to create adaptive treatment plans and make appropriate decisions based on the volumetric images acquired at treatment.";0
The novel histologic International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society classification system of lung adenocarcinoma is a stage-independent predictor of survival.;"PURPOSE: Our aim was to analyze and validate the prognostic impact of the novel International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC)/American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) proposal for an architectural classification of invasive pulmonary adenocarcinomas (ADCs) across all tumor stages. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The architectural pattern of a large cohort of 500 patients with resected ADCs (stages I to IV) was retrospectively analyzed in 5% increments and classified according to their predominant architecture (lepidic, acinar, solid, papillary, or micropapillary), as proposed by the IASLC/ATS/ERS. Subsequently, histomorphologic data were correlated with clinical data, adjuvant therapy, and patient outcome. RESULTS: Overall survival differed significantly between lepidic (78.5 months), acinar (67.3 months), solid (58.1 months), papillary (48.9 months), and micropapillary (44.9 months) predominant ADCs (P = .007). When patterns were lumped into groups, this resulted in even more pronounced differences in survival (pattern group 1, 78.5 months; group 2, 67.3 months; group 3, 57.2 months; P = .001). Comparable differences were observed for overall, disease-specific, and disease-free survival. Pattern and pattern groups were stage- and therapy-independent prognosticators for all three survival parameters. Survival differences according to patterns were influenced by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy; in particular, solid-predominant tumors had an improved prognosis with adjuvant radiotherapy. The predominant pattern was tightly linked to the risk of developing nodal metastases (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Besides all recent molecular progress, architectural grading of pulmonary ADCs according to the novel IASLC/ATS/ERS scheme is a rapid, straightforward, and efficient discriminator for patient prognosis and may support patient stratification for adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. It should be part of an integrated clinical, morphologic, and molecular subtyping to further improve ADC treatment.";0
Obstacles to participation in randomised cancer clinical trials: a systematic review of the literature.;"Accrual to clinical trials continues to be a problem in many countries including Australia despite its fundamental importance to the progress of evidence-based medicine. This paper reviews the current literature addressing the obstacles to accrual excluding those related to protocol design. An electronic search of the literature identified publications in oncology specifically addressing the obstacles to participation in clinical trials. This search was supplemented by searches of key oncology journals. Obstacles fall into three main categories - clinician, patient and system; however, there are overlaps between categories. Clinician behaviour is the most important of these. Exclusion of patients for reasons other than defined eligibility criteria, concerns about increased time requirements, and suboptimal communication with patients all affect accrual. Risk management strategies for clinical trials need to be individualised to address the obstacles most likely to negatively impact on accrual. Communication between clinician and patient appears to be a greater issue than previously recognised. Time concerns need to be addressed as generational change affects the expectations of the medical workforce.";0
Circulating tumour cells in prostate cancer patients receiving salvage radiotherapy.;INTRODUCTION: Within 10 years of radical prostatectomy (RP), up to 30% of prostate cancer (PCa) patients will have a rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA), requiring radiation therapy (RT). However, with current technology, distinction between local and distant recurrent PCa is not possible. This lack of an accurate test constrains the decision whether to offer systemic or local treatment. We hypothesise tests for detecting circulating tumour cells (CTCs) within the blood may assist with clinical decision-making and in this pilot study we investigated whether CTCs could be detected in this patient population using the CellSearch(R) system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected from PCa patients (n=26) prior to RT and 3 months following completion of RT. Samples were analysed for PSA level via immunoassay and CTC number using the CellSearch(R) system. RESULTS: CTCs could be detected in this patient population and following RT CTCs appeared to decrease. However, no association was observed between a higher PSA and an increased number of CTCs pre- or post-RT. Interestingly, patients who failed RT trended toward an increased/ unchanged number of CTCs following RT vs. a decreased number in patients with RT response. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that CTCs can be detected in early-stage PCa and suggest the possibility that post-treatment reduction in CTC levels may be indicative of RT response . We are currently evaluating CTCs in a larger cohort of patients to validate our preliminary findings and further investigate the prognostic value of CTCs in this patient population.;0
How effective are clinical pathways with and without online peer-review? An analysis of bone metastases pathway in a large, integrated National Cancer Institute-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center Network.;"PURPOSE: Clinical pathways are an important tool used to manage the quality in health care by standardizing processes. This study evaluated the impact of the implementation of a peer-reviewed clinical pathway in a large, integrated National Cancer Institute-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center Network. METHODS: In 2003, we implemented a clinical pathway for the management of bone metastases with palliative radiation therapy. In 2009, we required the entry of management decisions into an online tool that records pathway choices. The pathway specified 1 or 5 fractions for symptomatic bone metastases with the option of 10-14 fractions for certain clinical situations. The data were obtained from 13 integrated sites (3 central academic, 10 community locations) from 2003 through 2010. RESULTS: In this study, 7905 sites were treated with 64% of courses delivered in community practice and 36% in academic locations. Academic practices were more likely than community practices to treat with 1-5 fractions (63% vs. 23%; p < 0.0001). The number of delivered fractions decreased gradually from 2003 to 2010 for both academic and community practices (p < 0.0001); however, greater numbers of fractions were selected more often in community practices (p < 0.0001). Using multivariate logistic regression, we found that a significantly greater selection of 1-5 fractions developed after implementation online pathway monitoring (2009) with an odds ratio of 1.2 (confidence interval, 1.1-1.4) for community and 1.3 (confidence interval, 1.1-1.6) for academic practices. The mean number of fractions also decreased after online peer review from 6.3 to 6.0 for academic (p = 0.07) and 9.4 to 9.0 for community practices (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: This is one of the first studies to examine the efficacy of a clinical pathway for radiation oncology in an integrated cancer network. Clinical pathway implementation appears to be effective in changing patterns of care, particularly with online clinical peer review as a valuable aid to encourage adherence to evidence-based practice.";0
Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in the elderly.;The incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) peaks between the fifth and seventh decades of life. With prolongation of life expectancy, however, the proportion of elderly HNSCC patients is also increasing, which makes HNSCC in this life period an important issue for healthcare providers. With features characteristic to the older patient groups coupled with the inherent complexity of the disease, HNSCC in the elderly represents a considerable challenge to clinicians. Indeed, to expedite the progress and improve the healthcare system to meet the needs of this unique population of patients, several essential issues related to the clinical profile, diagnostics, optimal treatment and support are of concern and should be addressed in properly conducted clinical trials. In the present review, we analyzed a literature series comparing different age groups with regard to their clinical characteristics, therapy, outcome and quality of life in an attempt to determine their implications on treatment-decision-making for elderly patients with HNSCC.;0
The Personal Patient Profile-Prostate decision support for men with localized prostate cancer: a multi-center randomized trial.;"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this trial was to compare usual patient education plus the Internet-based Personal Patient Profile-Prostate, vs. usual education alone, on conflict associated with decision making, plus explore time-to-treatment, and treatment choice. METHODS: A randomized, multi-center clinical trial was conducted with measures at baseline, 1-, and 6 months. Men with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer (CaP) who sought consultation at urology, radiation oncology, or multi-disciplinary clinics in 4 geographically-distinct American cities were recruited. Intervention group participants used the Personal Patient Profile-Prostate, a decision support system comprised of customized text and video coaching regarding potential outcomes, influential factors, and communication with care providers. The primary outcome, patient-reported decisional conflict, was evaluated over time using generalized estimating equations to fit generalized linear models. Additional outcomes, time-to-treatment, treatment choice, and program acceptability/usefulness, were explored. RESULTS: A total of 494 eligible men were randomized (266 intervention; 228 control). The intervention reduced adjusted decisional conflict over time compared with the control group, for the uncertainty score (estimate -3.61; (confidence interval, -7.01, 0.22), and values clarity (estimate -3.57; confidence interval (-5.85,-1.30). Borderline effect was seen for the total decisional conflict score (estimate -1.75; confidence interval (-3.61,0.11). Time-to-treatment was comparable between groups, while undecided men in the intervention group chose brachytherapy more often than in the control group. Acceptability and usefulness were highly rated. CONCLUSION: The Personal Patient Profile-Prostate is the first intervention to significantly reduce decisional conflict in a multi-center trial of American men with newly diagnosed localized CaP. Our findings support efficacy of P3P for addressing decision uncertainty and facilitating patient selection of a CaP treatment that is consistent with the patient values and preferences.";0
A self-adaptive case-based reasoning system for dose planning in prostate cancer radiotherapy.;"PURPOSE: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in the male population. Radiotherapy is often used in the treatment for prostate cancer. In radiotherapy treatment, the oncologist makes a trade-off between the risk and benefit of the radiation, i.e., the task is to deliver a high dose to the prostate cancer cells and minimize side effects of the treatment. The aim of our research is to develop a software system that will assist the oncologist in planning new treatments. METHODS: A nonlinear case-based reasoning system is developed to capture the expertise and experience of oncologists in treating previous patients. Importance (weights) of different clinical parameters in the dose planning is determined by the oncologist based on their past experience, and is highly subjective. The weights are usually fixed in the system. In this research, the weights are updated automatically each time after generating a treatment plan for a new patient using a group based simulated annealing approach. RESULTS: The developed approach is analyzed on the real data set collected from the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, City Hospital Campus, UK. Extensive experiments show that the dose plan suggested by the proposed method is coherent with the dose plan prescribed by an experienced oncologist or even better. CONCLUSIONS: The developed case-based reasoning system enables the use of knowledge and experience gained by the oncologist in treating new patients. This system may play a vital role to assist the oncologist in making a better decision in less computational time; it utilizes the success rate of the previously treated patients and it can also be used in teaching and training processes.";0
Is there a role for clinical practice guidelines in multidisciplinary tumor board meetings? A descriptive study of knowledge transfer between research and practice.;"The aim of this study was to characterize practice patterns and decision-making processes of healthcare providers attending weekly neuro-oncology tumor board meetings, and to assess their familiarity with clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in neuro-oncology. Members of the Neuro-Oncology Tumor Team at two tertiary cancer centers completed a web-based questionnaire assessing characteristics of weekly tumor board meetings and perceptions of CPGs. Twenty-three (66%) tumor team members responded. Diagnostic imaging results and interpretation, medical, surgical, and/or radiation treatment planning, and pathology results and interpretation were the most commonly identified aspects of patient care discussed at tumor board meetings, and almost all respondents indicated that these meetings were ""very beneficial"" to their own practice. When deciding on a treatment plan, respondents rely most on the clinical expertise of colleagues, medical literature, personal experience, active clinical trial protocols, and published CPGs. Opinions of the local CPGs varied considerably, and while 56% of respondents supported regular discussion of them during meetings, only 32% indicated that they were routinely reviewed. Updating the literature more frequently, implementing a formal grading system for the evidence, and incorporating clinical care pathways were the most frequently cited methods to improve the CPGs. Tumor board meetings are beneficial to the treatment planning process for neuro-oncology patients.";0
Knowledge-based IMRT treatment planning for prostate cancer.;PURPOSE: To demonstrate the feasibility of using a knowledge base of prior treatment plans to generate new prostate intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans. Each new case would be matched against others in the knowledge base. Once the best match is identified, that clinically approved plan is used to generate the new plan. METHODS: A database of 100 prostate IMRT treatment plans was assembled into an information-theoretic system. An algorithm based on mutual information was implemented to identify similar patient cases by matching 2D beam's eye view projections of contours. Ten randomly selected query cases were each matched with the most similar case from the database of prior clinically approved plans. Treatment parameters from the matched case were used to develop new treatment plans. A comparison of the differences in the dose-volume histograms between the new and the original treatment plans were analyzed. RESULTS: On average, the new knowledge-based plan is capable of achieving very comparable planning target volume coverage as the original plan, to within 2% as evaluated for D98, D95, and D1. Similarly, the dose to the rectum and dose to the bladder are also comparable to the original plan. For the rectum, the mean and standard deviation of the dose percentage differences for D20, D30, and D50 are 1.8% +/- 8.5%, -2.5% +/- 13.9%, and -13.9% +/- 23.6%, respectively. For the bladder, the mean and standard deviation of the dose percentage differences for D20, D30, and D50 are -5.9% +/- 10.8%, -12.2% +/- 14.6%, and -24.9% +/- 21.2%, respectively. A negative percentage difference indicates that the new plan has greater dose sparing as compared to the original plan. CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrate a knowledge-based approach of using prior clinically approved treatment plans to generate clinically acceptable treatment plans of high quality. This semiautomated approach has the potential to improve the efficiency of the treatment planning process while ensuring that high quality plans are developed.;0
"Predictive ultrasound factors of lymphatic invasion in rectal cancer: ""extra-corporeal"" study.";OBJECTIVE: the accuracy of preoperative endorectal ultrasound in the status evaluation of lymph nodes is around 50-70%, with a lack of eco-morphological patterns of clinical use. Since, accurate local staging is of great value in prognosis and decision-making we decided to analyze the referenced eco-morphological parameters in a try to find a proper predictive tool of clinical help that could improve the accuracy of rectal ultrasound. MATERIAL AND METHOD: the resected specimens of 24 patients that were operated on by radical surgery because rectal cancer, without preoperative radiotherapy were suspended in warm water and ultrasound scanned (360 masculine circular probe with a transducer of 10 Mhz). All suspicious nodes were recorded and marked for the definitive histological report. RESULTS: from the 24 specimens, 318 nodes were imaged(210 benign and 100 involved). All ultrasound parameters analysed were significant but only lobulation, echogenicity and hilar reflection were independent values. An score system was design with the addition of all parameters that showed a sensitivity of 98%and specificity of 99,1%. CONCLUSIONS: our study shows that a careful study of ultra-sound lymph node images can get a high level of accuracy and better help in tailoring the treatment of any particular case.;0
Optimisation of breast cancer management in low-resource and middle-resource countries: executive summary of the Breast Health Global Initiative consensus, 2010.;The purpose of the Breast Health Global Initiative (BHGI) 2010 summit was to provide a consensus analysis of breast cancer control issues and implementation strategies for low-income and middle-income countries (LMCs), where advanced stages at presentation and poor diagnostic and treatment capacities contribute to lower breast cancer survival rates than in high-income countries. Health system and patient-related barriers were identified that create common clinical scenarios in which women do not present for diagnosis until their cancer has progressed to locally advanced or metastatic stages. As countries progress to higher economic status, the rate of late presentation is expected to decrease, and diagnostic and treatment resources are expected to improve. Health-care systems in LMCs share many challenges including national or regional data collection, programme infrastructure and capacity (including appropriate equipment and drug acquisitions, and professional training and accreditation), the need for qualitative and quantitative research to support decision making, and strategies to improve patient access and compliance as well as public, health-care professional, and policy-maker awareness that breast cancer is a cost-effective, treatable disease. The biggest challenges identified for low-income countries were little community awareness that breast cancer is treatable, inadequate advanced pathology services for diagnosis and staging, and fragmented treatment options, especially for the administration of radiotherapy and the full range of systemic treatments. The biggest challenges identified for middle-resource countries were the establishment and maintenance of data registries, the coordination of multidisciplinary centres of excellence with broad outreach programmes to provide community access to cancer diagnosis and treatment, and the resource-appropriate prioritisation of breast cancer control programmes within the framework of existing, functional health-care systems.;0
Identifying gaps in the locoregional management of early breast cancer: highlights from the Kyoto Consensus Conference.;"A consensus conference was held to investigate issues related to the local management of early breast cancer. Here, we highlight the major topics discussed at the conference and propose ideas for future studies. Regarding axillary management, we examined three major issues. First, we discussed whether the use of axillary reverse mapping could clarify the lymphatic system of breast and whether the ipsilateral arm might help avoid lymphedema. Second, the use of an indocyanine green fluorescent navigation system was discussed for intraoperative lymphatic mapping. These new issues should be examined further in practice. Finally, some agreement was reached on the importance of ""four-node diagnosis"" to aid in the diagnostic accuracy of sentinel nodes. Regarding breast treatment, there was general agreement that the clinical value of surgical margins in predicting local failure was dependent on the tumor's intrinsic biology and subtypes. For patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy, less extensive excision may be feasible in those who respond to systemic therapy in an acceptable manner. Most trials of preoperative chemotherapy lack outcome data on local recurrence. Therefore, there is a need for such data for overview analysis. We also agreed that radiation after mastectomy may be beneficial in node-positive cases where more than four nodes are involved. Throughout the discussions for both invasive and noninvasive disease, the investigation of nomograms was justified for major issues in the decision-making process, such as the presence or absence of microinvasion and the involvement of nonsentinel nodes in sentinel node-positive patients.";0
Intelligent ePR system for evidence-based research in radiotherapy: proton therapy for prostate cancer.;"PURPOSE: Proton therapy (PT) utilizes high energy particle proton beam to kill cancer cells at the target region for target cancer therapy. Due to the physical properties of the proton beam, PT delivers dose with higher precision and no exit dose compared to conventional radiotherapy. In PT, patient data are distributed among multiple systems, a hindrance to research on efficacy and effectiveness. A data mining method and a treatment plan navigator utilizing the infrastructure and data repository of a PT electronic patient record (ePR) was developed to minimize radiation toxicity and improve outcomes in prostate cancer treatment. MATERIALS/METHOD(S): The workflow of a proton therapy treatment in a radiation oncology department was reviewed, and a clinical data model and data flow were designed. A prototype PT ePR system with DICOM compliance was developed to manage prostate cancer patient images, treatment plans, and related clinical data. The ePR system consists of four main components: (1) Data Gateway; (2) ePR Server; (3) Decision Support Tools; and (4) Visualization and Display Tools. Decision support and visualization tools are currently developed based on DICOM images, DICOM-RT and DICOM-RT-ION objects data from prostate cancer patients treated with hypofractionation protocol proton therapy were used for evaluating ePR system effectiveness. Each patient data set includes a set of computed tomography (CT) DICOM images and four DICOM-RT and RT-ION objects. In addition, clinical outcomes data collected from PT cases were included to establish a knowledge base for outcomes analysis. RESULTS: A data mining search engine and an intelligent treatment plan navigator (ITPN) were developed and integrated with the ePR system. Evaluation was based on a data set of 39 PT patients and a hypothetical patient. CONCLUSIONS: The ePR system was able to facilitate the proton therapy workflow. The PT ePR system was feasible for prostate cancer patient treated with hypofractionation protocol in proton therapy. This ePR system improves efficiency in data collection and integration to facilitate outcomes analysis.";0
Developing best practice response to carbon monoxide incidents: a toolkit for health protection frontline staff.;"OBJECTIVES: Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning represents a significant public health burden. CO incidents require multiple responders, including the Health Protection Agency (HPA). However, best practice guidance does not yet exist in the UK for chemicals. Since CO is a good template for chemical incidents, the authors aimed to develop an electronic 'best practice' CO incident response toolkit which could serve as a blueprint for chemicals in general, and have compatibility with HPZone, the electronic decision support system being implemented across the HPA. STUDY DESIGN: Public health guidance development. METHODS: (1) Literature review of CO incidents, risk management, public health, toxicology and environmental guidance; (2) expert opinion; (3) synthesis of information; (4) writing the toolkit; and (5) consultation and toolkit testing. RESULTS: The draft toolkit was designed integrating a best practice algorithm, risk assessment, links to CO guidance, and template incident forms. The risk assessment model is in development but key intermediate outcomes of this were proposed case definitions for CO exposure. CONCLUSION: The toolkit has been successfully piloted and further consultation and refinement will follow. It provides a platform for the expansion of electronic decision support tools in chemical incidents management with the potential for HPZone functionality.";0
Adaptive seamless design for an efficacy trial of replication-competent adenovirus-mediated suicide gene therapy and radiation in newly-diagnosed prostate cancer (ReCAP Trial).;PURPOSE: Cumulative evidence has suggested investigation of the efficacy of Replication-Competent Adenovirus-mediated Suicide Gene Therapy in newly-diagnosed Prostate Cancer (ReCAP). There is a challenge in designing an efficacy trial for newly-diagnosed prostate cancer given its long natural history. The regulatory agency recommended a Phase II trial for safety before conducting the efficacy trial. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The ReCAP trial is an adaptive seamless, multi-site open-label, randomized Phase II/III trial. Two hundred eighty men will be randomized to receive either replication-competent adenovirus-mediated suicide gene therapy followed by radiation (Arm 1) or radiation alone (Arm 2). Phase II trial component will include the first 21 patients in Arm 1 with complete toxicity through day 90 for safety evaluation. The primary efficacy endpoint is the time free from biochemical and/or clinical failure (FFF). The secondary efficacy endpoints are 2-year prostate biopsies and overall survival. Unequal spaced interim looks are proposed with the adaptive sample-size re-estimation. RESULTS: This trial has been approved by the FDA for the study therapy investigation and is currently recruiting patients. CONCLUSIONS: Challenges remain in designing newly-diagnosed prostate cancer trials. Adaptive seamless design is time-saving and a cost-effective design in the development of novel medical therapies, but requires a specified statistical plan in the decision process involved.;0
Integrating case-based reasoning with an electronic patient record system.;Electronic patient records (EPRs) contain a wealth of patient-related data and capture clinical problem-solving experiences and decisions. Excelicare is such a system which is also a platform for the national generic clinical system in the UK. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents, ExcelicareCBR, a case-based reasoning (CBR) system which has been developed to complement Excelicare. Objective of this work is to integrate CBR to support clinical decision making by harnessing electronic patient records for clinical experience reuse. METHODS: CBR is a proven problem solving methodology in which past solutions are reused to solve new problems. A key challenge that we address in this paper is how to extract and represent a case from an EPR. Using an example from the lung cancer domain we demonstrate our generic case representation approach where Excelicare fields are mapped to case features. Once the case base is populated with cases containing data from the EPRs database a standard weighted k-nearest neighbour algorithm combined with a genetic algorithm based feature weighting mechanism is used for case retrieval and reuse. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that incorporating case authoring functionality and a generic retrieval mechanism were key to successful integration of ExcelicareCBR. This paper also demonstrates how the application of CBR can enable sharing of lessons learned through the retrieval and reuse of EPRs captured as cases in a case base.;0
Decision-making in localized prostate cancer: lessons learned from an online support group.;"OBJECTIVE: * To investigate patient-to-patient communication with regard to decision-making in localized prostate cancer; as most of it is done in private, online support groups are a unique means for this task. PATIENTS AND METHODS: * Over a 32-month period, we screened 501 threads in the largest German online support group for prostate cancer. * Threads started by questioners newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and stating decision-making as the key topic were included; in all, 82 (16.4%) threads met these criteria. * Two independent investigators characterized every thread following a standardized protocol. * Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U-test were applied for group analyses. A complementary qualitative linguistic approach was chosen. RESULTS: * Threads were most commonly started to ask for therapy recommendations (66%), information on the course of treatment (46%) and emotional support (46%). * Answers consisted of treatment recommendations (40%), emotional support (37%) and personal experiences (28%). * A second opinion on the biopsy cores (51%) and additional imaging (40%) were common suggestions. * The rate of advice for radical prostatectomy (RP) vs radiotherapy was 67 vs 82%. Thus, surgery was less recommended in our sample (P = 0.01); 75% of the men with an initial therapeutic preference were finally confirmed herein. * Linguistic analysis showed that posters frequently use a tentative language style and that common language is avoided. CONCLUSIONS: * Patients readily receive information, advice and emotional support as part of an online support group. * The scientific evaluation of an online support group is a complementary way of getting to know our patients' needs and worries. * Patient-physician contact can benefit from this knowledge.";0
Reirradiation combined with hyperthermia in breast cancer recurrences: overview of experience in Erasmus MC.;For superficial hyperthermia a custom-built multi-applicator multi-amplifier superficial hyperthermia system operating at 433 MHz is utilised. Up to 6 Lucite Cone applicators can be used simultaneously to treat an area of 600 cm2. Temperatures are measured continuously with fibre optic multi-sensor probes. For patients with non-standard clinical problems, hyperthermia treatment planning is used to support decision making with regard to treatment strategy. In 74% of our patients with recurrent breast cancer treated with a reirradiation scheme of 8 fractions of 4 Gy in 4 weeks, combined with 4 or 8 hyperthermia treatments, a complete response is achieved, approximately twice as high as the CR rate following the same reirradation alone. The CR rate in tumours smaller than 30 mm is 80-90%, for larger tumours it is 65%. Hyperthermia appears beneficial for patients with microscopic residual tumour as well. To achieve high CR rates it is important to heat the whole radiotherapy field, and to use an adequate heating technique.;0
MEDECOR--a medical decorporation tool to assist first responders, receivers, and medical reach-back personnel in triage, treatment, and risk assessment after internalization of radionuclides.;"After a radiological dispersal device (RDD) event, it is possible for radionuclides to enter the human body through inhalation, ingestion, and skin and wound absorption. From a health physics perspective, it is important to know the magnitude of the intake to perform dosimetric assessments. From a medical perspective, removal of radionuclides leading to dose aversion (hence risk reduction) is of high importance. The efficacy of medical decorporation strategies is extremely dependent upon the time of treatment delivery after intake. The ""golden hour,"" or more realistically 3-4 h, is optimal when attempting to increase removal of radionuclides from extracellular fluids prior to cellular incorporation. To assist medical first response personnel in making timely decisions regarding appropriate treatment delivery modes, it is desirable to have a software tool that compiles existing radionuclide decorporation therapy data and allows a user to perform simple diagnosis leading to optimized decorporation treatment strategies. In its most simple application, the software is a large database of radionuclide decorporation strategies and treatments. The software can also be used in clinical interactive mode, in which the user inputs the radionuclide, estimated activity, route of intake and time since exposure. The software makes suggestions as to the urgency of treatment (i.e., triage) and the suggested therapy. Current developments include risk assessment which impacts the potential risk of delivered therapy and resource allocation of therapeutic agents. The software, developed for the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND), is titled MEDECOR (MEdical DECORporation). The MEDECOR tool was designed for use on both personal digital assistant and laptop computer environments. The tool was designed using HTML/Jscript, to allow for ease of portability amongst different computing platforms. This paper presents the features of MEDECOR, results of testing at a major NATO exercise, and future development of this tool into MEDECOR2.";0
A software tool for determination of breast cancer treatment methods using data mining approach.;"In this work, breast cancer treatment methods are determined using data mining. For this purpose, software is developed to help to oncology doctor for the suggestion of application of the treatment methods about breast cancer patients. 462 breast cancer patient data, obtained from Ankara Oncology Hospital, are used to determine treatment methods for new patients. This dataset is processed with Weka data mining tool. Classification algorithms are applied one by one for this dataset and results are compared to find proper treatment method. Developed software program called as ""Treatment Assistant"" uses different algorithms (IB1, Multilayer Perception and Decision Table) to find out which one is giving better result for each attribute to predict and by using Java Net beans interface. Treatment methods are determined for the post surgical operation of breast cancer patients using this developed software tool. At modeling step of data mining process, different Weka algorithms are used for output attributes. For hormonotherapy output IB1, for tamoxifen and radiotherapy outputs Multilayer Perceptron and for the chemotherapy output decision table algorithm shows best accuracy performance compare to each other. In conclusion, this work shows that data mining approach can be a useful tool for medical applications particularly at the treatment decision step. Data mining helps to the doctor to decide in a short time.";0
Neonatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis: sifting the evidence for a diagnostic plan and treatment strategy.;Although cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) is an uncommon disorder in neonates, the incumbent morbidity, mortality, and adverse neurodevelopmental sequelae highlight the importance of establishing an early diagnosis with an appropriate therapeutic plan. The clinical signs and symptoms of the condition are subtle and invariably masquerade under the umbrella of a broad spectrum of neonatal illnesses. A high index of diagnostic suspicion is essential for investigating and initiating treatment in a timely fashion before major complications ensue. Recent advances in accessible radiographic techniques with reduced radiation exposure have facilitated rapid diagnosis of thrombosis in both the superficial and deep plexuses of the cerebral venous systems. The absence of large-scale randomized trials and solid prospective smaller-sample-sized studies of neonates with CSVT has compromised our ability to develop efficacious treatment decisions. In this review of the scientific literature we offer understanding of the complex etiology of CSVT and inherent problems involved in the diagnosis and treatment of the disorder and focus on the limitations in current follow-up. An approach to neonatal CSVT is proposed on the basis of the available evidence from guidelines, registries, prospective and retrospective infant studies, and case series.;0
The Chest Pain Choice trial: a pilot randomized trial of a decision aid for patients with chest pain in the emergency department.;"BACKGROUND: Chest pain is a common presenting complaint in the emergency department (ED). Despite the frequency with which clinicians evaluate patients with chest pain, accurately determining the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and sharing risk information with patients is challenging. The aims of this study are (1) to develop a decision aid (CHEST PAIN CHOICE) that communicates the short-term risk of ACS and (2) to evaluate the impact of the decision aid on patient participation in decision-making and resource use. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a protocol for a parallel, 2-arm randomized trial to compare an intervention group receiving CHEST PAIN CHOICE to a control group receiving usual ED care. Adults presenting to the Saint Mary's Hospital ED in Rochester, MN USA with a primary complaint of chest pain who are being considered for admission for prolonged ED observation in a specialized unit and urgent cardiac stress testing will be eligible for enrollment. We will measure the effect of CHEST PAIN CHOICE on six outcomes: (1) patient knowledge regarding their short-term risk for ACS and the risks of radiation exposure; (2) quality of the decision making process; (3) patient and clinician acceptability and satisfaction with the decision aid; (4) the proportion of patients who decided to undergo observation unit admission and urgent cardiac stress testing; (5) economic costs and healthcare utilization; and (6) the rate of delayed or missed ACS. To capture these outcomes, we will administer patient and clinician surveys after each visit, obtain video recordings of the clinical encounters, and conduct 30-day phone follow-up. DISCUSSION: This pilot randomized trial will develop and evaluate a decision aid for use in ED chest pain patients at low risk for ACS and provide a preliminary estimate of its effect on patient participation in decision-making and resource use.

Preliminary treatment considerations among men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.;"OBJECTIVE: To assess factors that may influence men's preference for surgery versus nonsurgical options among newly diagnosed patients considering treatments for local-stage prostate cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Prostate cancer patients were approached at urology clinics after diagnosis but prior to starting treatment in California, South Carolina, and Texas. Using a survey about the treatment decision-making process, patients were asked about their likes and dislikes of 5 common treatment options: surgery (prostatectomy), brachytherapy, external beam radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and watchful waiting. METHODS: Logistic regression identified associations between treatment characteristics and choice of prostatectomy compared with nonsurgical options, controlling for demographic, clinical, and psychological covariates. RESULTS: Of the 198 eligible men who returned the baseline survey, 59% indicated they only considered surgery and 41% considered at least 1 nonsurgical option. In multivariate analysis, patients who thought treatment efficacy was a primary concern were significantly more likely to prefer surgery only (odds ratio [OR] = 6.20, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.74, 22.10); those indicating concern about personal burden were significantly more likely to prefer nonsurgical options (OR = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.02, 0.22). Advice of friends and relatives and concerns over side effects were not significantly associated with preference for surgery versus other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Men's perceptions about treatment efficacy and the personal burden of treatment dominated preferences for surgery versus nonsurgical options. Interventions to aid treatment decision making should account for these elements to minimize the impact of physician biases and patient misperceptions on men's decisions as how best to manage their prostate cancer.";0
Physicians' awareness and attitudes toward decision aids for patients with cancer;Purpose: Patient decision aids are interventions designed to help patients make deliberative choices about their treatment options and have been shown to significantly improve patient outcomes. Although considered optimal, decision aids are not widely used in clinical practice for cancer treatment. The objectives of this study are to determine physicians' awareness and use of decision aids, physicians' perceptions of the major barriers to the use of decision aids, and physician characteristics predictive of use of decision aids in clinical practice. Methods: A population-based survey was mailed to general surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists. Results: The survey was mailed to 878 physicians, and the overall response rate to the survey was 64.5%. The majority of the participants were male and working in community hospitals for more than 10 years. Overall, 69% of the respondents were aware of decision aids, and 46% were aware of decision aids relevant to their practice. However, only 24% were currently using decision aids. The main barriers to the use of decision aids were reported as lack of awareness, lack of resources, and lack of time. Multivariate analysis showed specialty to be the only physician characteristic influencing the use of decision aids. Conclusion: Approximately one third of physicians treating cancer patients are not aware of what decision aids are, and only 24% are currently using decision aids in clinical practice. Strategies to increase physician awareness about decision aids and to implement these tools into clinical practice are important.;0
Validation of new prognostic and predictive scores by sequential testing approach.;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For practitioners, the question arises how their own patient population differs from that used in large-scale analyses resulting in new scores and nomograms and whether such tools actually are valid at a local level and thus can be implemented. A recent article proposed an easy-to-use method for the in-clinic validation of new prediction tools with a limited number of patients, a so-called sequential testing approach. The present study evaluates this approach in scores related to radiation oncology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three different scores were used, each predicting short overall survival after palliative radiotherapy (bone metastases, brain metastases, metastatic spinal cord compression). For each scenario, a limited number of consecutive patients entered the sequential testing approach (Table 1). The positive predictive value (PPV) was used for validation of the respective score and it was required that the PPV exceeded 80%. RESULTS: For two scores, validity in the own local patient population could be confirmed after entering 13 and 17 patients, respectively (Figures 1 and 3). For the third score, no decision could be reached even after increasing the sample size to 30 (Figure 2). CONCLUSION: In-clinic validation of new predictive tools with sequential testing approach should be preferred over uncritical adoption of tools which provide no significant benefit to local patient populations. Often the necessary number of patients can be reached within reasonable time frames even in small oncology practices. In addition, validation is performed continuously as the data are collected.;0
Preferences for outcomes of treatment for rectal cancer: patient and clinician utilities and their application in an interactive computer-based decision aid.;"PURPOSE: To quantify the importance that patients and clinicians assign to specific quality-of-life outcomes associated with the treatment of rectal cancer and to demonstrate a clinical application of these data in a computer-based multidimension decision aid (Annalisa). METHODS: For patients, a researcher-administered questionnaire using the time trade-off method was used to quantify the importance of nine outcomes. Information was ascertained from clinicians by use of a self-administered questionnaire. Responses were ranked and compared between groups. Mean values for each outcome were entered into Annalisa. RESULTS: Overall, 103 patients, 87 colorectal surgeons, 97 medical oncologists, and 80 radiation oncologists participated. For all groups, local cancer recurrence in the pelvis and fecal incontinence (mean utility scores 0.53 and 0.57, respectively) were the two outcomes to most avoid. In Annalisa, the ""best fit"" treatment for patients and surgeons was a low anterior resection with postoperative chemotherapy, whereas for medical and radiation oncologists the best-fit treatment was surgery alone. CONCLUSION: Local recurrence and fecal incontinence are considered the worst outcomes by patients and clinicians alike, but values for other outcomes vary. Decision aids that incorporate patients' individual values with evidence-based data hold considerable potential to optimize treatment decision-making.";0

Modeling plan-related clinical complications using machine learning tools in a multiplan IMRT framework.;PURPOSE: To predict organ-at-risk (OAR) complications as a function of dose-volume (DV) constraint settings without explicit plan computation in a multiplan intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) framework. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Several plans were generated by varying the DV constraints (input features) on the OARs (multiplan framework), and the DV levels achieved by the OARs in the plans (plan properties) were modeled as a function of the imposed DV constraint settings. OAR complications were then predicted for each of the plans by using the imposed DV constraints alone (features) or in combination with modeled DV levels (plan properties) as input to machine learning (ML) algorithms. These ML approaches were used to model two OAR complications after head-and-neck and prostate IMRT: xerostomia, and Grade 2 rectal bleeding. Two-fold cross-validation was used for model verification and mean errors are reported. RESULTS: Errors for modeling the achieved DV values as a function of constraint settings were 0-6%. In the head-and-neck case, the mean absolute prediction error of the saliva flow rate normalized to the pretreatment saliva flow rate was 0.42% with a 95% confidence interval of (0.41-0.43%). In the prostate case, an average prediction accuracy of 97.04% with a 95% confidence interval of (96.67-97.41%) was achieved for Grade 2 rectal bleeding complications. CONCLUSIONS: ML can be used for predicting OAR complications during treatment planning allowing for alternative DV constraint settings to be assessed within the planning framework.;0
Analysis of outcomes in radiation oncology: an integrated computational platform.;Radiotherapy research and outcome analyses are essential for evaluating new methods of radiation delivery and for assessing the benefits of a given technology on locoregional control and overall survival. In this article, a computational platform is presented to facilitate radiotherapy research and outcome studies in radiation oncology. This computational platform consists of (1) an infrastructural database that stores patient diagnosis, IMRT treatment details, and follow-up information, (2) an interface tool that is used to import and export IMRT plans in DICOM RT and AAPM/RTOG formats from a wide range of planning systems to facilitate reproducible research, (3) a graphical data analysis and programming tool that visualizes all aspects of an IMRT plan including dose, contour, and image data to aid the analysis of treatment plans, and (4) a software package that calculates radiobiological models to evaluate IMRT treatment plans. Given the limited number of general-purpose computational environments for radiotherapy research and outcome studies, this computational platform represents a powerful and convenient tool that is well suited for analyzing dose distributions biologically and correlating them with the delivered radiation dose distributions and other patient-related clinical factors. In addition the database is web-based and accessible by multiple users, facilitating its convenient application and use.;0
Informatics in radiology: DICOM-RT-based electronic patient record information system for radiation therapy.;Comprehensive clinical imaging data and additional relevant information are crucial for the planning and delivery of radiation therapy in patients with cancer. Multiple stand-alone systems that make use of technologic advances in imaging, treatment planning, and treatment delivery acquire or generate key data during the course of radiation therapy. However, the data are scattered in various systems throughout the radiation therapy department, thereby compromising efficient clinical work flow. In 1997 and 1999, the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard was extended from radiology to radiation therapy with the ratification of seven DICOM-RT objects. These objects helped set the standard for (a) data integration and interoperability between radiation therapy equipment and information systems from different manufacturers, and (b) the use of DICOM diagnostic images in radiation therapy. More recently, key radiation therapy imaging and informatics data have been integrated to form an open-architecture comprehensive radiation therapy electronic patient record (ePR) system. The benefits of such a DICOM-RT-based ePR system are threefold: it can be used as a foundation for performing effective and efficient clinical services, as a common platform for radiation therapy data exchange and expert consultation, and for medical imaging informatics research in developing innovative decision support tools and a knowledge base for improved treatment with radiation therapy.;0
Developing a clinical decision model: MR spectroscopy to differentiate between recurrent tumor and radiation change in patients with new contrast-enhancing lesions.;"OBJECTIVE: Differentiation between recurrent neoplasm and postradiation change in patients previously treated for primary brain tumors is often difficult based on imaging features alone. The purpose of this study was to develop a method using alterations in the ratios of standard brain metabolites-choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)-to predict the probability of tumor recurrence in patients previously treated for brain tumors with new contrast-enhancing lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients who had undergone treatment for primary brain tumors in whom routine MRI showed new contrast-enhancing lesions were retrospectively studied. The final diagnosis was assigned using histopathology (n = 13) or imaging follow-up (n = 20; range, 2-27 months). Ratios of three metabolites (Cho, Cr, and NAA) were calculated, and the results were correlated with the final diagnosis using a Wilcoxon's rank sum analysis. A logistic regression model was then used to create a prediction model based on the most statistically significant ratio. RESULTS: Elevations of the metabolic ratios Cho/Cr (p < 0.001) and Cho/NAA (p < 0.001) and a decrease in the ratio NAA/Cr (p = 0.018) were found in patients with recurrent tumor (n = 20) versus those with postradiation change (n = 13). A prediction model using the Cho/NAA ratio yielded a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 69.2%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92. CONCLUSION: An elevated Cho/NAA ratio correlated with evidence of tumor recurrence and allowed creation of a prediction rule to aid in lesion classification. The results suggest that MR spectroscopy is a useful tool in assigning patients with nonspecific enhancing lesions to either invasive biopsy or conservative management.";0
Radiation therapy for children: evolving technologies in the era of ALARA.;The evolution of ever more sophisticated oncologic imaging and technologies providing far more precise radiation therapy have combined to increase the utilization of sophisticated radiation therapy in childhood cancer. For a majority of children with common central nervous system, soft tissue, bone, and dysontogenic neoplasms, local irradiation is fundamental to successful multi-disciplinary management. Along with more precise target volume definition and radiation delivery, new technologies provide added certainty of patient positioning (electronic portal imaging, cone beam CT) and conformality of dose delivery (3-D conformal irradiation, intensity modulated radiation therapy, proton beam therapy). Each of the major areas of technology development are able to better confine the high-dose region to the intended target, but they are also associated with the potential for larger volumes of uninvolved tissues being exposed to low radiation doses. The latter issue plays a role in documented levels of secondary carcinogenesis, sometimes with greater anticipated incidence than that seen in conventional radiation therapy. Parameters related to carcinogenesis, such as dose-volume relationships and neutron contamination that accompanies high-energy photon irradiation and proton therapy, can be identified, sometimes modulated, and accepted as part of the clinical decision process in fine tuning radiation therapy in this more vulnerable age group.;0
Improving understanding of adjuvant therapy options by using simpler risk graphics.;"BACKGROUND: To help oncologists and breast cancer patients make informed decisions about adjuvant therapies, online tools such as Adjuvant! provide tailored estimates of mortality and recurrence risks. However, the graphical format used to display these results (a set of 4 horizontal stacked bars) may be suboptimal. The authors tested whether using simpler formats would improve comprehension of the relevant risk statistics. METHODS: A total of 1,619 women, aged 40-74 years, completed an Internet-administered survey vignette about adjuvant therapy decisions for a patient with an estrogen receptor-positive tumor. Participants were randomized to view 1 of 4 risk graphics, a base version that mirrored the Adjuvant! format, an alternate graph that showed only 2 options (those that included hormonal therapy), a graph that used a pictograph format, or a graph that included both changes. Outcome measures included comprehension of key statistics, time required to complete the task, and graph-perception ratings. RESULTS: The simplifying format changes significantly improved comprehension, especially when both changes were implemented together. Compared with participants who viewed the base 4-option bar graph, respondents who, instead, viewed a 2-option pictograph version were more accurate when they reported the incremental risk reduction achievable from adding chemotherapy to hormonal therapy (77% vs 51%; P< .001), answered that question more quickly (median time, 28 seconds vs 42 seconds; P< .001), and liked the graph more (mean, 7.67 vs 6.88; P< .001). CONCLUSIONS: Although most patients will only view risk calculators such as Adjuvant! in consultation with their clinicians, simplifying design graphics could significantly improve patients' comprehension of statistics essential for informed decision making about adjuvant therapies.";0
Efficient use of continuous, real-time prostate localization.;Recent technological advances make it possible to monitor prostate movement during radiation delivery. Using previously published data from 35 patients who underwent continuous localization during prostate cancer treatment, we simulated various interventions to identify the radiation-gating and patient-repositioning strategies that least prolonged the time to complete the daily treatment. Acceptable response protocols were those that resulted in at least 95% of patients' prostates remaining within the planning margins at least 95% of the time. Gating and repositioning were not necessary for margins of 7 or 10 mm because of the rarity of excursions at these margins. However, intervention was routinely necessary for margins of 3 and 5 mm. In simulated interventions for which the therapist could reposition the treatment couch without entering the room, the most time-efficient response protocol was to reposition the couch immediately after the prostate position was outside the treatment margins. In simulations in which the therapist had to enter the room to reposition the couch, overall treatment time could be reduced and accuracy could be increased by manually gating treatment for 11 and 21 s for 3- and 5-mm margins, respectively, before interrupting treatment to reposition the treatment couch.;0
Comparison of IMRT treatment plans between linac and helical tomotherapy based on integral dose and inhomogeneity index.;Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is an advanced treatment technology for radiation therapy. There are several treatment planning systems (TPS) that can generate IMRT plans. These plans may show different inhomogeneity indices to the planning target volume (PTV) and integral dose to organs at risk (OAR). In this study, we compared clinical cases covering different anatomical treatment sites, including head and neck, brain, lung, prostate, pelvis, and cranio-spinal axis. Two treatment plans were developed for each case using Pinnacle(3) and helical tomotherapy (HT) TPS. The inhomogeneity index of the PTV and the non-tumor integral dose (NTID) were calculated and compared for each case. Despite the difference in the number of effective beams, in several cases, NTID did not increase from HT as compared to the step-and-shoot delivery method. Six helical tomotherapy treatment plans for different treatment sites have been analyzed and compared against corresponding step-and-shoot plans generated with the Pinnacle(3) planning system. Results show that HT may produce plans with smaller integral doses to healthy organs, and fairly homogeneous doses to the target as compared to linac-based step-and-shoot IMRT planning in special treatment site such as cranio-spinal.;0
Influence of Pro-Qura-generated plans on postimplant dosimetric quality: a review of a multi-institutional database.;"The influence of Pro-Qura-generated plans vs. community-generated plans on postprostate brachytherapy dosimetric quality was compared. In the Pro-Qura database, 2933 postplans were evaluated from 57 institutions. A total of 1803 plans were generated by Pro-Qura and 1130 by community institutions. Iodine-125 (125I) plans outnumbered Palladium 103 (103Pd) plans by a ratio of 3:1. Postimplant dosimetry was performed in a standardized fashion by overlapping the preimplant ultrasound and the postimplant computed tomography (CT). In this analysis, adequacy was defined as a V100 > 80% and a D90 of 90% to 140% for both isotopes along with a V150 < 60% for 125I and < 75% for 103Pd. The mean postimplant V100 and D90 were 88.6% and 101.6% vs. 89.3% and 102.3% for Pro-Qura and community plans, respectively. When analyzed in terms of the first 8 sequence groups (10 patients/sequence group) for each institution, Pro-Qura planning resulted in less postimplant variability for V100 (86.2-89.5%) and for D90 (97.4-103.2%) while community-generated plans had greater V100 (85.3-91.2%) and D90 (95.9-105.2%) ranges. In terms of sequence groups, postimplant dosimetry was deemed ""too cool"" in 11% to 30% of cases and ""too hot"" in 12% to 27%. On average, no clinically significant postimplant dosimetric differences were discerned between Pro-Qura and community-based planning. However, substantially greater variability was identified in the community-based plan cohort. It is possible that the Pro-Qura plan and/or the routine postimplant dosimetric evaluation may have influenced dosimetric outcomes at community-based centers.";0
Prostate tumor alignment and continuous, real-time adaptive radiation therapy using electromagnetic fiducials: clinical and cost-utility analyses.;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy, utility, and cost effectiveness of a new electromagnetic patient positioning and continuous, real-time monitoring system, which uses permanently implanted resonant transponders in the target (Calypso 4D Localization System and Beacon transponders, Seattle, WA) to continuously monitor tumor location and movement during external beam radiation therapy of the prostate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This clinical trial studied 43 patients at 5 sites. All patients were implanted with 3 transponders each. In 41 patients, the system was used for initial alignment at each therapy session. Thirty-five patients had continuous monitoring during their radiation treatment. Over 1,000 alignment comparisons were made to a commercially available kV X-ray positioning system (BrainLAB ExacTrac, Munich, Germany). Using decision analysis and Markov processes, the outcomes of patients were simulated over a 5-year period and measured in terms of costs from a payer's perspective and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: All patients had satisfactory transponder implantations for monitoring purposes. In over 75% of the treatment sessions, the correction to conventional positioning (laser and tattoos) directed by an electromagnetic patient positioning and monitoring system was greater than 5 mm. Ninety-seven percent (34/35) of the patients who underwent continuous monitoring had target motion that exceeded preset limits at some point during the course of their radiation therapy. Exceeding preset thresholds resulted in user intervention at least once during the therapy in 80% of the patients (28/35). Compared with localization using ultrasound, electronic portal imaging devices (EPID), or computed tomography (CT), localization with the electromagnetic patient positioning and monitoring system yielded superior gains in QALYs at comparable costs. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients positioned with conventional tattoos and lasers for prostate radiation therapy were found by use of the electromagnetic patient positioning and monitoring system to have alignment errors exceeding 5 mm. Almost all patients undergoing external beam radiation of the prostate have been shown to have target organ movement exceeding 3 mm during radiation therapy delivery. The ability of the electromagnetic technology to monitor tumor target location during the same time as radiation therapy is being delivered allows clinicians to provide real time adaptive radiation therapy for prostate cancer. This permits clinicians to intervene when the prostate moves outside the radiation isocenter, which should decrease adverse events and improve patient outcomes. Additionally, a cost-utility analysis has demonstrated that the electromagnetic patient positioning and monitoring system offers patient outcome benefits at a cost that falls well within the payer's customary willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per QALY.;0
An examination of the initial cancer consultation of medical and radiation oncologists using the Cancode interaction analysis system.;This study provides an analysis of the structure of the initial cancer consultation, the consultation styles of medical and radiation oncologists, and their effect on patient outcomes. One hundred and fifty-five cancer patients attending their first consultation with either a medical or radiation oncologist were audiotaped and the transcripts were analysed using the Cancode computer interaction analysis system. Findings revealed that medical oncologists allowed patients and their families more input into the consultation and were rated as warmer and more patient-centred compared with radiation oncologists. However, radiation oncologists spent a longer period discussing, and were more likely to bring up, social support issues with patients. Both medical and radiation oncologists varied their consultation style according to the patient's gender, age, anxiety levels, prognosis, and education. Patients seeing an oncologist who was rated as warmer and discussed a greater number of psychosocial issues had better psychological adjustment and reduced anxiety after consultation. These findings provide current evidence that may be used to inform improvements of communication skills training for oncologists and highlight the need for future communication research to separately consider oncologists from different disciplines.;0
Radioimmunotherapy for lymphoma - analysis of clinical trials and treatment algorithms.;Ibritumomab, an (90)Yttrium ((90)Y) labelled radioimmunoconjugate, is registered in Europe to treat follicular lymphomas. Its mode of action combines the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies with the efficiency of radiotherapy, making it a unique and useful therapeutic agent. This paper is for haemato-oncologists with a decent practice in lymphoma therapy, who have not yet used ibritumomab themselves. It summarizes clinical trials with radioimmunotherapy, indicating clinical situations where it may be specifically useful.;0
Convection-enhanced delivery of cintredekin besudotox (interleukin-13-PE38QQR) followed by radiation therapy with and without temozolomide in newly diagnosed malignant gliomas: phase 1 study of final safety results;"Objective: Cintredekin besudotox (CB), a recombinant cytotoxin consisting of interleukin-13 and truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin, binds selectively to interleukin-13R alpha2 receptors overexpressed by malignant gliomas. This study assessed the safety of CB administered by convection-enhanced delivery followed by standard external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with or without temozolomide (Temodar; Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ) in patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas. Methods: After gross total resection of the tumor, two to four intraparenchymal catheters were stereotactically placed and CB (0.25 or 0.5 microg/mL) was infused for 96 hours. This was followed, 10 to 14 days later, by EBRT (5940-6100 cGy, 5 d/wk for 6-7 wk) with or without temozolomide (75 mg/m/d, 7 d/wk during EBRT). Safety was assessed during an 11-week observation period after catheter placement Results: Twenty-two patients (12 men, 10 women; median age, 55 yr; 21 with glioblastoma multiforme and one with an anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma) were enrolled. None of the patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities in the first two cohorts (0.25 microg/mL CB + EBRT [n = 3] and 0.25 microg/mL CB + EBRT + temozolomide [n = 3]). One patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (Grade 4 seizure) in the third cohort (0.5 microg/mL CB + EBRT [n = 6]). Six patients in the final cohort (0.5 microg/mL CB + EBRT + temozolomide [n = 10]) completed treatment, and one patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (Grade 3 aphasia and confusion). Four patients were not considered evaluable for a dose decision and were replaced. CB related adverse events occurring in more than one patient were fatigue, gait disturbance, nystagmus, and confusion. No Grade 3 to 4 hematological toxicities were observed. Conclusion: CB (0.5 microg/mL) administered via convection-enhanced delivery before standard radiochemotherapy seems to be well tolerated in adults with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas. Further clinical study assessment is warranted.";0
An exact approach to direct aperture optimization in IMRT treatment planning.;"We consider the problem of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning using direct aperture optimization. While this problem has been relatively well studied in recent years, most approaches employ a heuristic approach to the generation of apertures. In contrast, we use an exact approach that explicitly formulates the fluence map optimization (FMO) problem as a convex optimization problem in terms of all multileaf collimator (MLC) deliverable apertures and their associated intensities. However, the number of deliverable apertures, and therefore the number of decision variables and constraints in the new problem formulation, is typically enormous. To overcome this, we use an iterative approach that employs a subproblem whose optimal solution either provides a suitable aperture to add to a given pool of allowable apertures or concludes that the current solution is optimal. We are able to handle standard consecutiveness, interdigitation and connectedness constraints that may be imposed by the particular MLC system used, as well as jaws-only delivery. Our approach has the additional advantage that it can explicitly account for transmission of dose through the part of an aperture that is blocked by the MLC system, yielding a more precise assessment of the treatment plan than what is possible using a traditional beamlet-based FMO problem. Finally, we develop and test two stopping rules that can be used to identify treatment plans of high clinical quality that are deliverable very efficiently. Tests on clinical head-and-neck cancer cases showed the efficacy of our approach, yielding treatment plans comparable in quality to plans obtained by the traditional method with a reduction of more than 75% in the number of apertures and a reduction of more than 50% in beam-on time, with only a modest increase in computational effort. The results also show that delivery efficiency is very insensitive to the addition of traditional MLC constraints; however, jaws-only treatment requires about a doubling in beam-on time and number of apertures used. Finally, we showed the importance of accounting for transmission effects when assessing or, preferably, optimizing treatment plan quality.";0
Radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery for screen-detected ductal carcinoma in situ: indications and utilisation in the UK. Interim findings from the Sloane Project.;Use of radiotherapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) varies according to country, precedent and prejudice. Results from a preliminary analysis of the data available within the UK Sloane Project can be appreciated in the context of the uncertainty concerning the selection of adjuvant RT following BCS for DCIS. There was a marked geographical variation in the use of RT within the United Kingdom. However, overall, patients with DCIS treated with BCS were significantly more likely to have RT planned (and given) if they had large (> or =15 mm), intermediate or high-grade tumours or if central comedo-type necrosis was present. Unexpectedly, margin width did not appear to have a significant effect on the decision-making process. However, the Van Nuys Prognostic Index did significantly affect the chances of getting planned RT in the univariate analysis, suggesting that clinicians may be starting to use this scoring system in routine practice to assist in decision making.;0
A knowledge-based imaging informatics approach for managing proton beam therapy of cancer patients.;"The need for a unified patient-oriented information system to handle complex proton therapy (PT) imaging and informatics data during the course of patient treatment is becoming steadily apparent due to the ever increasing demands for better diagnostic treatment planning and more accurate information. Currently, this information is scattered throughout each of the different treatment and information systems in the oncology department. Furthermore, the lack of organization with standardized methods makes it difficult and time-consuming to navigate through the maze of data, resulting in challenges during patient treatment planning. We present a methodology to develop this electronic patient record (ePR) system based on DICOM standards and perform knowledge-based medical imaging informatics research on specific clinical scenarios where patients are treated with PT. Treatment planning is similar in workflow to traditional radiation therapy (RT) methods such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which utilizes a priori knowledge to drive the treatment plan in an inverse manner. In March 2006, two new RT objects were drafted in a DICOM-RT Supplement 102 specifically for ion therapy, which includes PT. The standardization of DICOM-RT-ION objects and the development of a knowledge base as well as decision-support tools that can be add-on features to the ePR DICOM-RT system were researched. This methodology can be used to extend to PT and the development of future clinical decision-making scenarios during the course of the patient's treatment that utilize ""inverse treatment planning."" We present the initial steps of this imaging and informatics methodology for PT and lay the foundation for development of future decision-support tools tailored to cancer patients treated with PT. By integrating decision-support knowledge and tools designed to assist in the decision-making process, a new and improved ""knowledge-enhanced treatment planning"" approach can be realized.";0
Image-assisted knowledge discovery and decision support in radiation therapy planning.;"The need for quantified knowledge and decision-support tools to handle complex radiation therapy (RT) imaging and informatics data is becoming steadily apparent. Lessons can be learned from current CAD applications in radiology. This paper proposes a methodology to develop this quantified knowledge and decision-support tools to facilitate RT treatment planning. The methodology is applied to cancer patient cases treated by intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The use of the ""inverse treatment planning"" and imaging intensive nature of IMRT allows for the development of such image-assisted tools for supporting decision-making thus providing better workflow efficiency and more precise dose predictions.";0
Therapy of acute wounds with water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA).;"Water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA) as a special form of heat radiation with a high tissue penetration and with a low thermal load to the skin surface acts both by thermal and thermic as well as by non-thermal and non-thermic effects. wIRA produces a therapeutically usable field of heat in the tissue and increases tissue temperature, tissue oxygen partial pressure, and tissue perfusion. These three factors are decisive for a sufficient tissue supply with energy and oxygen and consequently as well for wound healing and infection defense. wIRA can considerably alleviate the pain (with remarkably less need for analgesics) and diminish an elevated wound exudation and inflammation and can show positive immunomodulatory effects. wIRA can advance wound healing or improve an impaired wound healing both in acute and in chronic wounds including infected wounds. Even the normal wound healing process can be improved.A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study with 111 patients after major abdominal surgery at the University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany, showed with 20 minutes irradiation twice a day (starting on the second postoperative day) in the group with wIRA and visible light VIS (wIRA(+VIS), approximately 75% wIRA, 25% VIS) compared to a control group with only VIS a significant and relevant pain reduction combined with a markedly decreased required dose of analgesics: during 230 single irradiations with wIRA(+VIS) the pain decreased without any exception (median of decrease of pain on postoperative days 2-6 was 13.4 on a 100 mm visual analog scale VAS 0-100), while pain remained unchanged in the control group (p<0.001). The required dose of analgesics was 57-70% lower in the subgroups with wIRA(+VIS) compared to the control subgroups with only VIS (median 598 versus 1398 ml ropivacaine, p<0.001, for peridural catheter analgesia; 31 versus 102 mg piritramide, p=0.001, for patient-controlled analgesia; 3.4 versus 10.2 g metamizole, p=0.005, for intravenous and oral analgesia). During irradiation with wIRA(+VIS) the subcutaneous oxygen partial pressure rose markedly by approximately 30% and the subcutaneous temperature by approximately 2.7 degrees C (both in a tissue depth of 2 cm), whereas both remained unchanged in the control group: after irradiation the median of the subcutaneous oxygen partial pressure was 41.6 (with wIRA) versus 30.2 mm Hg in the control group (p<0.001), the median of the subcutaneous temperature was 38.9 versus 36.4 degrees C (p<0.001). The overall evaluation of the effect of irradiation, including wound healing, pain and cosmesis, assessed on a VAS (0-100 with 50 as indifferent point of no effect) by the surgeon (median 79.0 versus 46.8, p<0.001) or the patient (79.0 versus 50.2, p<0.001) was markedly better in the group with wIRA compared to the control group. This was also true for single aspects: Wound healing assessed on a VAS by the surgeon (median 88.6 versus 78.5, p<0.001) or the patient (median 85.8 versus 81.0, p=0.040, trend) and cosmetic result assessed on a VAS by the surgeon (median 84.5 versus 76.5, p<0.001) or the patient (median 86.7 versus 73.6, p=0.001). In addition there was a trend in favor of the wIRA group to a lower rate of total wound infections (3 of 46, approximately 7%, versus 7 of 48, approximately 15%, p=0.208) including late infections after discharge, caused by the different rate of late infections after discharge: 0 of 46 in the wIRA group and 4 of 48 in the control group. And there was a trend towards a shorter postoperative hospital stay: 9 days in the wIRA group versus 11 days in the control group (p=0.037). The principal finding of this study was that postoperative irradiation with wIRA can improve even a normal wound healing process.A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study with 45 severely burned children at the Children's Hospital Park Schonfeld, Kassel, Germany, showed with 30 minutes irradiation once a day (starting on the first day, day of burn as day 1) in the group with wIRA and visible light VIS (wIRA(+VIS), approximately 75% wIRA, 25% VIS) compared to a control group with only VIS a markedly faster reduction of wound size. On the fifth day (after 4 days with irradiation) decision was taken, whether surgical debridement of necrotic tissue was necessary because of deeper (second degree, type b) burns (11 of 21 in the group with wIRA, 14 of 24 in the control group) or non-surgical treatment was possible (second degree, type a, burns). The patients treated conservatively were kept within the study and irradiated till complete reepithelialization. The patients in the group with wIRA showed a markedly faster reduction of wound area: a median reduction of wound size of 50% was reached already after 7 days compared to 9 days in the control group, a median reduction of wound size of 90% was already achieved after 9 days compared to 13 days in the control group. In addition the group with wIRA showed superior results till 3 months after the burn in terms of the overall surgical assessment of the wound, cosmesis, and assessment of effects of irradiation compared to the control group. In a prospective, randomized, controlled study with 12 volunteers at the University Medical Center Charite, Berlin, Germany, within each volunteer 4 experimental superficial wounds (5 mm diameter) as an acute wound model were generated by suction cup technique, removing the roof of the blister with a scalpel and a sterile forceps (day 1). 4 different treatments were used and investigated during 10 days: no therapy, only wIRA(+VIS) (approximately 75% wIRA, 25% VIS; 30 minutes irradiation once a day), only dexpanthenol (= D-panthenol) cream once a day, wIRA(+VIS) and dexpanthenol cream once a day. Healing of the small experimental wounds was from a clinical point of view excellent with all 4 treatments. Therefore there were only small differences between the treatments with slight advantages of the combination wIRA(+VIS) and dexpanthenol cream and of dexpanthenol cream alone concerning relative change of wound size and assessment of feeling of the wound area. However laser scanning microscopy with a scoring system revealed differences between the 4 treatments concerning the formation of the stratum corneum (from first layer of corneocytes to full formation) especially on the days 5-7: fastest formation of the stratum corneum was seen in wounds treated with wIRA(+VIS) and dexpanthenol cream, second was wIRA(+VIS) alone, third dexpanthenol cream alone and last were untreated wounds. Bacterial counts of the wounds (taken every 2 days) showed, that wIRA(+VIS) and the combination of wIRA(+VIS) with dexpanthenol cream were able to inhibit the colonisation with physiological skin flora up to day 5 when compared with the two other groups (untreated group and group with dexpanthenol cream alone). At any investigated time, the amount of colonisation under therapy with wIRA(+VIS) alone was lower (interpreted as more suppressed) compared with the group with wIRA(+VIS) and dexpanthenol cream. During rehabilitation after hip and knee endoprosthetic operations the resorption of wound seromas and wound hematomas was both clinically and sonographically faster and pain was reduced by irradiation with wIRA(+VIS). wIRA can be used successfully for persistent postoperative pain e.g. after thoracotomy.As perspectives for wIRA it seems clinically prudent to use wIRA both pre- and postoperatively, e.g. in abdominal and thoracic operations. wIRA can be used preoperatively (e.g. during 1-2 weeks) to precondition donor and recipient sites of skin flaps, transplants or partial-thickness skin grafts, and postoperatively to improve wound healing and to decrease pain, inflammation and infections at all mentioned sites. wIRA can be used to support routine pre- or intraoperative antibiotic administration or it might even be discussed to replace this under certain conditions by wIRA.";0
Use of benchmark dose-volume histograms for selection of the optimal technique between three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy in prostate cancer;"Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop and validate our own benchmark dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of bladder and rectum for both conventional three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and to evaluate quantitatively the benefits of using IMRT vs. 3D-CRT in treating localized prostate cancer. Methods and materials: During the implementation of IMRT for prostate cancer, our policy was to plan each patient with both 3D-CRT and IMRT. This study included 31 patients with T1b to T2c localized prostate cancer, for whom we completed double-planning using both 3D-CRT and IMRT techniques. The target volumes included prostate, either with or without proximal seminal vesicles. Bladder and rectum DVH data were summarized to obtain an average DVH for each technique and then compared using two-tailed paired t test analysis. Results: For 3D-CRT our bladder doses were as follows: mean 28.8 Gy, v60 16.4%, v70 10.9%; rectal doses were: mean 39.3 Gy, v60 21.8%, v70 13.6%. IMRT plans resulted in similar mean dose values: bladder 26.4 Gy, rectum 34.9 Gy, but lower values of v70 for the bladder (7.8%) and rectum (9.3%). These benchmark DVHs have resulted in a critical evaluation of our 3D-CRT techniques over time. Conclusion: Our institution has developed benchmark DVHs for bladder and rectum based on our clinical experience with 3D-CRT and IMRT. We use these standards as well as differences in individual cases to make decisions on whether patients may benefit from IMRT treatment rather than 3D-CRT.";0
A prognostic scoring system for locoregional control in nasopharyngeal carcinoma following conformal radiotherapy.;"PURPOSE: This study established a prognostic scoring system for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which estimates the probability of locoregional (LR) control following definitive conformal radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with nondisseminated NPC at initial presentation (n = 630) were enrolled in this study. All patients had magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck and were treated with conformal radiotherapy. Among them, 93% had concurrent chemotherapy, and 76% had postradiation chemotherapy. The extent of the primary tumor, age at diagnosis, primary tumor size, tumor and nodal classification, histology, and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level before treatment were included in the analysis for building a prognostic scoring system. The end point for this study was LR control. RESULTS: The prognostic score was defined as the number of adverse prognostic factors present at diagnosis. Four factors had similarly independent prognostic effects (hazard ratio, 2.0-2.6): age >40 years, histologic WHO type I-II, serum LDH level > or =410 U/L, and involvement of two or more sites of the following anatomic structures, i.e., sphenoid floor, clivus marrow, clivus cortex, prevertebral muscles, and petrous bone. The score predicted the 5-year probability of LR control as follows: 0 (15% of the patients), 100%; 1 (42% of the patients), 93%; 2 (29% of the patients), 83%; 3 or higher (13% of the patients), 71%. CONCLUSION: This scoring system is useful in the decision-making for individual patients and the design of clinical trials to improve LR control for advanced-stage NPC.";0
Learning the relationship between patient geometry and beam intensity in breast intensity-modulated radiotherapy.;Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has become an effective tool for cancer treatment with radiation. However, even expert radiation planners still need to spend a substantial amount of time adjusting IMRT optimization parameters in order to get a clinically acceptable plan. We demonstrate that the relationship between patient geometry and radiation intensity distributions can be automatically inferred using a variety of machine learning techniques in the case of two-field breast IMRT. Our experiments show that given a small number of human-expert-generated clinically acceptable plans, the machine learning predictions produce equally acceptable plans in a matter of seconds. The machine learning approach has the potential for greater benefits in sites where the IMRT planning process is more challenging or tedious.;0
Enhancing patient participation by training radiation oncologists.;"OBJECTIVE: Several studies have shown that patients' active participation to their medical interaction is beneficial for their information processing and their quality of life. Unfortunately, cancer patients often act rather passively in contact with their oncologists. We investigated whether cancer patients' participation in radiation therapy consultations could be enhanced by specific communicative behaviours of the radiation oncologists (ROs). METHODS: Eight ROs and 160 patients participated; 80 patients in the pre training group and 80 patients in the post training group. The ROs were trained to use specific communicative behaviours that are supposed to encourage patient participation. In the training special attention was paid to communicative requirements in the first minutes of the consultation. The communicative behaviours of the ROs and the cancer patients were measured by the Roter Interaction Analysis System, and compared before and after the RO training. RESULTS: From the start throughout the entire consultation, patients in the post training group participated more in interactions than patients in the pre training group: they discussed more psychosocial issues, expressed more concerns and contributed more to decision-making. CONCLUSION: Cancer patients' participation in the initial radiation oncology consultations can be increased by training of ROs. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The results suggest that doctors working with cancer patients should receive communication training and feedback on a regular base.";0
Clinical features of American versus non-American gynecologic cancer patients requesting information from a proprietary web-based decision-support program.;"PURPOSE: As the Internet can potentially substantially reduce geographic barriers to the dissemination of health-related information, it would be interesting to know if non-American women with gynecologic malignancies accessing United States (US)-based cancer Web sites differ from American patients with the same illness. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Aggregate data from individuals providing personal clinical information into one of four proprietary gynecologic cancer (cervix, endometrial, newly diagnosed and recurrent ovarian cancers) decision-support programs (NexProfiler Treatment Option Tools for Cancer; NexCura Inc., Seattle WA, USA) currently embedded within approximately 100 established cancer-related Web sites were examined for differences between American versus non-American patient populations. RESULTS: In this analysis, which included >15,000 patients, American and non-American gynecologic cancer patients were remarkably similar in most clinical characteristics, including age, stage of disease at presentation, overall health, and desire to receive information regarding clinical trials. Notable differences included features suggestive of a more aggressive surgical philosophy in the US (e.g., higher percentage of American recurrent ovarian cancer patients reported they had undergone a secondary surgical procedure; greater use of radiotherapy in non-American cervical cancer patients). CONCLUSION: Despite differences in geographic location and health care delivery systems, American and non-American patients with gynecologic malignancies and with access to Internet-based cancer information exhibit few, but notable, differences in self-reported clinical characteristics.";0
Estimating the optimal radiotherapy utilization for carcinoma of the central nervous system, thyroid carcinoma, and carcinoma of unknown primary origin from evidence-based clinical guidelines.;BACKGROUND: In this one in a series of articles, the objective was to estimate the ideal proportion of patients with cancer who should receive radiotherapy at least once during the course of their illness based on the best available evidence. This estimate should be useful in planning for future radiotherapy facilities. Optimal rates of radiotherapy for patients with central nervous system (CNS) carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, or carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP) have not been studied previously. METHODS: A systematic review of evidence-based treatment guidelines for the treatment of CNS carcinoma, CUP, and thyroid carcinoma was undertaken. An optimal radiotherapy utilization tree was constructed for each of these malignancies depicting the indications for radiotherapy at various stages of disease. The proportion of patients who had clinical attributes that indicated a possible benefit from radiotherapy was calculated by adding epidemiological data to the radiotherapy utilization tree. The optimal proportion of patients who should receive radiotherapy was then calculated using specialized decision-analysis software. Sensitivity analyses using univariate analysis and Monte Carlo simulations were performed. RESULTS: The optimal rates of radiotherapy utilization for carcinoma of the CNS, thyroid carcinoma, and CUP were 92%, 10%, and 61%, respectively. Comparison with actual rates of utilization in South Australia, Sweden, and the U.S. suggested an under-utilization of radiotherapy for CNS carcinoma and CUP. However, the actual rates of radiotherapy for thyroid carcinoma exceeded the optimal rate for some jurisdictions, although some data may have included radioactive iodine, which was not included in the current project. CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to estimate optimal radiotherapy utilization rates based on evidence. This methodology allowed a comparison of optimal rates with actual rates to identify areas in which improvements in the evidence-based use of radiotherapy can be made, and it may provide valuable data for future radiotherapy service planning.;0
Simultaneous beam geometry and intensity map optimization in intensity-modulated radiation therapy.;"PURPOSE: In current intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plan optimization, the focus is on either finding optimal beam angles (or other beam delivery parameters such as field segments, couch angles, gantry angles) or optimal beam intensities. In this article we offer a mixed integer programming (MIP) approach for simultaneously determining an optimal intensity map and optimal beam angles for IMRT delivery. Using this approach, we pursue an experimental study designed to (a) gauge differences in plan quality metrics with respect to different tumor sites and different MIP treatment planning models, and (b) test the concept of critical-normal-tissue-ring--a tissue ring of 5 mm thickness drawn around the planning target volume (PTV)--and its use for designing conformal plans. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Our treatment planning models use two classes of decision variables to capture the beam configuration and intensities simultaneously. Binary (0/1) variables are used to capture ""on"" or ""off"" or ""yes"" or ""no"" decisions for each field, and nonnegative continuous variables are used to represent intensities of beamlets. Binary and continuous variables are also used for each voxel to capture dose level and dose deviation from target bounds. Treatment planning models were designed to explicitly incorporate the following planning constraints: (a) upper/lower/mean dose-based constraints, (b) dose-volume and equivalent-uniform-dose (EUD) constraints for critical structures, (c) homogeneity constraints (underdose/overdose) for PTV, (d) coverage constraints for PTV, and (e) maximum number of beams allowed. Within this constrained solution space, five optimization strategies involving clinical objectives were analyzed: optimize total intensity to PTV, optimize total intensity and then optimize conformity, optimize total intensity and then optimize homogeneity, minimize total dose to critical structures, minimize total dose to critical structures and optimize conformity simultaneously. We emphasize that the objectives that include optimizing conformity make use of the critical-normal-tissue-ring. Three tumor sites: head-and-neck, pediatric brain, and prostate are used for comparison. RESULTS: The critical-normal-tissue-ring acts as a good device for enforcing conformity. Trends in the characteristics and quality of plans resulting from each model were observed. Attempts to reduce dose to critical structures tend to worsen PTV conformity (1.542 to 3.092) and homogeneity (1.223 to 1.984), depending on the relative size and spatial distance of the critical structures to the PTV. When the critical structures are relatively small compared with the PTV (as in the case for the pediatric brain tumor, where each is less than 15% in volume), dose reduction to critical structures is accompanied by much worse scores in conformity (2.482) and homogeneity (1.984). When the critical structures are larger, as in the case of head-and-neck (approximately 50%), the conformity and homogeneity deterioration is less significant (1.542 and 1.239, respectively). There is a clear tradeoff between homogeneity, conformity, and minimum dose to organs at risk (OARs). For head-and-neck and pediatric brain tumor, the model that minimizes total dose to critical structures and optimizes conformity simultaneously offers a compromise among these factors, resulting in reduced critical structure dose with conformal and homogeneous plans. In the prostate case, the tumor is smaller than the two large nearby critical structures, and all models provide very homogeneous PTV dose distribution. However, minimizing dose to critical structures worsens conformity, as it spreads the radiation to the area surrounding the PTV. The maximum dose to the critical structures also increases slightly. Compared with plans used in the clinic which generally have uniformly spaced beam angles, the optimal clinically acceptable plans obtained via the methods herein do not have equispaced beams. The optimal beam angles returned appear to be nonintuitive, and depend on PTV size and geometry and the spatial relationship between the tumor and critical structures. CONCLUSIONS: The MIP model described allows simultaneous optimization over the space of beamlet fluence weights and beam and couch angles. Based on experiments with tumor data, this approach can return good plans that are clinically acceptable and practical. This work distinguishes itself from recent IMRT research in several ways. First, in previous methods beam angles are selected before intensity map optimization. Herein, we employ 0/1 variables to model the set of candidate beams, and thereby allow the optimization process itself to select optimal beams. Second, instead of incorporating dose-volume criteria within the objective function as in previous work, herein, a combination of discrete and continuous variables associated with each voxel provides a mechanism to strictly enforce dose-volume criteria within the constraints. Third, using the construct of critical-normal-tissue-ring within the objective function can enhance the achievement of conformal plans. Based on the three tumor sites considered, it appears that volume and spatial geometry with respect to the PTV are important factors to consider when selecting objectives to optimize, and in estimating how well suited a particular model is for achieving a specified goal.";0
OncoSurge: a strategy for improving resectability with curative intent in metastatic colorectal cancer.;"PURPOSE: Most patients with colorectal liver metastases present to general surgeons and oncologists without a specialist interest in their management. Since treatment strategy is frequently dependent on the response to earlier treatments, our aim was to create a therapeutic decision model identifying appropriate procedure sequences. METHODS: We used the RAND Corporation/University of California, Los Angeles Appropriateness Method (RAM) assessing strategies of resection, local ablation and chemotherapy. After a comprehensive literature review, an expert panel rated appropriateness of each treatment option for a total of 1,872 ratings decisions in 252 cases. A decision model was constructed, consensus measured and results validated using 48 virtual cases, and 34 real cases with known outcomes. RESULTS: Consensus was achieved with overall agreement rates of 93.4 to 99.1%. Absolute resection contraindications included unresectable extrahepatic disease, more than 70% liver involvement, liver failure, and being surgically unfit. Factors not influencing treatment strategy were age, primary tumor stage, timing of metastases detection, past blood transfusion, liver resection type, pre-resection carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and previous hepatectomy. Immediate resection was appropriate with adequate radiologically-defined resection margins and no portal adenopathy; other factors included presence of < or = 4 or > 4 metastases and unilobar or bilobar involvement. Resection was appropriate postchemotherapy, independent of tumor response in the case of < or = 4 metastases and unilobar liver involvement. Resection was appropriate only for > 4 metastases or bilobar liver involvement, after tumor shrinkage with chemotherapy. When possible, resection was preferred to local ablation. CONCLUSION: The results were incorporated into a decision matrix, creating a computer program (OncoSurge). This model identifies individual patient resectability, recommending optimal treatment strategies. It may also be used for medical education.";0
An optimized workflow for the integration of biological information into radiotherapy planning: experiences with T1w DCE-MRI.;Planning of radiotherapy is often difficult due to restrictions on morphological images. New imaging techniques enable the integration of biological information into treatment planning and help to improve the detection of vital and aggressive tumour areas. This might improve clinical outcome. However, nowadays morphological data sets are still the gold standard in the planning of radiotherapy. In this paper, we introduce an in-house software platform enabling us to combine images from different imaging modalities yielding biological and morphological information in a workflow driven approach. This is demonstrated for the combination of morphological CT, MRI, functional DCE-MRI and PET data. Data of patients with a tumour of the prostate and with a meningioma were examined with DCE-MRI by applying pharmacokinetic two-compartment models for post-processing. The results were compared with the clinical plans for radiation therapy. Generated parameter maps give additional information about tumour spread, which can be incorporated in the definition of safety margins.;0
Relative importance of PSA in prostate cancer treatment.;METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective study was conducted to (1) determine the relationship between baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and initial treatment decisions for prostate cancer (surgery, hormone therapy, radiation, or watchful waiting) and (2) estimate the impact of PSA progression (doubling or three consecutive rises) on subsequent treatment decisions. Patient records (n=1116) from three community urology practices and a large academic health system were reviewed. Multivariate models were fitted to assess the relationship between initial treatment and baseline PSA, Gleason score, race, number of comorbid conditions and age and between PSA progression and time to subsequent therapy (adjusted for other factors). RESULTS: Baseline PSA was a significant predictor of initial treatment among men with localized disease with the likelihood of hormone therapy increasing with higher PSA levels and the likelihood of surgery decreasing steadily with higher PSA levels. PSA was the strongest predictor of hormone therapy as first choice followed by age. Age followed by PSA was the strongest predictor of surgery as first treatment as well as radiation therapy. Initial PSA levels did not predict the choice of watchful waiting. Patients with PSA progression were eight times (95% CI: 5.3-12.1) more likely to initiate a subsequent therapy than patients who did not have PSA progression when controlling for other predictors. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice, PSA significantly impacts the urologist's primary therapy choice and determines when they introduce subsequent treatments.;0
Patient-recognition data-mining model for BCG-plus interferon immunotherapy bladder cancer treatment.;Bladder cancer is the fifth most common malignant disease in the United States with an annual incidence of around 63,210 new cases and 13,180 deaths. The cost for providing care for patients with bladder cancer disease is high. Bladder cancer treatment options such as immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, transurethral resection, and cystectomy, are used with varying success rates. In this research, data from a nationwide bacillus Calmette-Gue rin (BCG) plus interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) immunotherapy clinical trial was considered. Data mining algorithms were used to analyze the effectiveness of immunotherapy treatment and to understand the prominent parameters and their interactions. The extracted knowledge was used to build a patient recognition model for prediction of treatment outcomes. The data was analyzed to understand the impact of various parameters on the treatment outcome. A list of significant parameters such as cumulative tumor size, presence of residual disease, stages of prior bladder cancer, current state of bladder cancer, and the presence of current bladder cancer (T1) is provided. The decision-making approach outlined in the paper supplemented with additional knowledge bases will lead to a comprehensive analytical road map of the BCG/IFN-alpha immunotherapy treatment. It will provide individualized guidelines for each stage of the treatment as well as measure the success of the treatment.;0
A visual query-by-example image database for chest CT images: potential role as a decision and educational support tool for radiologists.;Primary reading or further evaluation of diagnostic imaging examination often needs a comparison between the actual findings and the relevant prior images of the same patient or similar radiological data found in other patients. This support is of clinical importance and may have significant effects on physicians' examination reading efficiency, service-quality, and work satisfaction. We developed a visual query-by-example image database for storing and retrieving chest CT images by means of a visual browser Image Management Environment (IME) and tested its retrieval efficiency. The visual browser IME included four fundamental features (segmentation, indexing, quick load and recall, user-friendly interface) in an integrated graphical environment for a user-friendly image database management. The system was tested on a database of 2000 chest CT images, randomly chosen from the digital archives of our institutions. A sample of eight heterogeneous images were used as queries and, for each of them a team of three expert radiologists selected the most similar images from the database (a set of 15 images containing similar abnormalities in the same position of the query). The sensitivity and the positive predictive factor, both averaged over the 8 test queries and 15 answers, were respectively 0.975 and 0.91 The IME system is currently under evaluation at our institutions as an experimental application. We consider it a useful work-in-progress tool for clinical practice facilitating searches for a variety of radiological tasks.;0
Radiosurgery planning supported by the GEMSS grid.;GEMSS (Grid Enabled Medical Simulation Services IST-2001-37153) is an EU project funded to provide a test bed for Grid-enabled health applications. Its purpose is evaluation of Grid computing in the health sector. The health context imposes particular constraints on Grid infrastructure design, and it is this that has driven the feature set of the middleware. In addition to security, the time critical nature of health applications is accommodated by a Quality of Service component, and support for a well defined business model is also included. This paper documents experience of a GEMSS compliant radiosurgery application running within the Medical Physics department at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in the UK. An outline of the Grid-enabled RAPT radiosurgery application is presented and preliminary experience of its use in the hospital environment is reported. The performance of the software is compared against GammaPlan (an industry standard) and advantages/disadvantages are highlighted. The RAPT software relies on features of the GEMSS middleware that are integral to the success of this application, and together they provide a glimpse of an enabling technology that can impact upon patient management in the 21st century.;0
Utilities for prostate cancer health states in men aged 60 and older;"Purpose: We sought to measure utilities for prostate cancer health states in older men. Methods: A total of 162 men aged 60 years or older (52% of whom had been diagnosed with prostate cancer) provided standard gamble utilities for 19 health states associated with prostate cancer or its treatment using an interactive, computer-based utility assessment program. Demographics and experience with specific health states were examined as predictors of ratings using ordinary least squares regression analysis. Results: Mean utilities ranged from 0.67 to 0.84 for living with symptom-free cancer under conservative management (""watchful waiting"") and from 0.71 to 0.89 for symptoms occurring with treatment (prostatectomy, radiation, and hormone ablation). For long-term treatment complications, bowel problems (0.71) were rated as significantly worse than impotence (0.89), urinary difficulty (0.88), or urinary incontinence (0.83). Combinations of these conditions were rated as significantly worse than individual component states. Men who had experienced impotence or urinary incontinence rated these states as slightly better than men who had not experienced the specific problems. Conclusions: Both ""watchful waiting"" and treatment complications from prostate cancer treatments can have large impacts on quality of life. Mean ratings are important for use in policy-making and cost-effectiveness analyses. Variation in ratings across patients suggests that mean scores do not reflect individual preferences and that shared decision-making may be best for clinical decisions.";0
The brain tumor board: lessons to be learned from an interdisciplinary conference.;BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to analyze the work of the interdisciplinary Brain Tumor Board (BTB) which was established at Freiburg University Hospital in 1998. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1998 to December 2003, a total of 1,516 patients were discussed in 259 meetings of the BTB. The protocols of the BTB were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: In 79% of the patients, the diagnosis was based on histological findings or a typical radiological appearance of a lesion, or both. This group was composed of 4 subgroups: 28% benign skull base tumors (19% meningiomas, 4% pituitary adenomas, 3% acoustic schwannomas, 2% others), 24% primary brain tumors of glial origin (8% glioblastomas, 12% gliomas other than glioblastomas, 5% oligoastrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas), 19% brain metastases, and 8% other brain or skull base tumors. In 13% of the cases, the exact diagnosis was still unknown when the patient was presented. 8% of the presentations were motivated by nontumorous interdisciplinary problems (e.g. arterio-venous malformations). The recommendations given by the BTB included: 23% further diagnostic procedures (11% non-invasive examinations, 12% stereotactic biopsies), 57% active antitumoral therapy (22% resection, 17% fractionated radiotherapy, 13% radiosurgery, 5% chemotherapy, <1% embolization), 20% no treatment (14% watchful waiting, 6% supportive care). 91% of the BTB recommendations were realized within 3 months. CONCLUSION: Interdisciplinary care seems to be particularly necessary in patients with benign skull base tumors, gliomas and brain metastases. Decisions made in a small interdisciplinary group of experts have a high potential of subsequently being realized.;0
Magnetic source imaging supports clinical decision making in glioma patients.;OBJECTIVE: This study addresses the potential utility of preoperative functional imaging with magnetoencephalography (MEG) for the selection of glioma patients who are likely to benefit from resective surgical treatment regarding postoperative morbidity. METHODS: One hundred and nineteen patients with gliomas adjacent to sensorimotor, visual and speech related brain areas were investigated preoperatively with a MAGNES II biomagnetometer. In each patient the pre-surgical evaluation was focussed on the visual, sensorimotor cortex and/or of the speech related brain areas. A grading system was then used according to the distance of the MEG activation sources to the nearest tumour border to determine the further treatment. The therapeutic options consisted in conservative treatment, stereotactic biopsy and/or a radiation and chemotherapy, substantial cytoreduction and the gross total removal of the lesion. RESULTS: From 119 investigated patients, 55 patients (46.2%) were not considered for surgery due to tumour invasion to functional cortex. Sixty four patients (53.8%) were chosen for resective surgery. In the surgical group only four patients (6.2%) suffered from neurological deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic source imaging (MSI) proved to be a valuable help in the clinical decision making process of lesions adjacent to functional important brain areas. The relative high number of patients in whom MSI warns of the postoperative crippling sequelae may lead to a better selection of patients who benefit from resective surgery. This method may help to find the patients for whom conservative treatment seems to be more favourable concerning quality of life in the surviving time.;0
A four-dimensional simulation model of tumour response to radiotherapy in vivo: parametric validation considering radiosensitivity, genetic profile and fractionation.;The aim of this paper is to present the current state of a four-dimensional simulation model of solid tumour growth and response to radiotherapy developed by our group. The most prominent points of the algorithms describing the fundamental biological phenomena involved are outlined. A specific application of the model to a selected clinical case of glioblastoma multiforme is described and comparative studies are performed, using various exploratory values of the model parameters. Qualitative agreement with clinical observations has been achieved. Special emphasis is laid on the variability of radiosensitivity parameters throughout the cell cycle and on the influence of the genetic profile of the tumour on its radiosensitivity. The results of the simulation are three-dimensionally reconstructed. A valuable tool for getting insight into the biology of tumour growth and response to radiotherapy and at the same time an advanced patient specific decision support system is expected to emerge after the completion of the necessary extensive clinical evaluation.;0
Cost measurement in economic evaluations of health care: whom to ask?;PURPOSES: The purposes of this study were 1) to investigate the feasibility of using providers' administrative systems for the assessment of healthcare utilization in economic evaluations performed alongside multicenter studies, 2) to assess the convergent validity of patients' and providers' reports of care, and 3) to investigate whether differences between providers' and patients' reports are related to age, gender, health, recall period, and volumes of care. METHODS: Data were obtained as part of a cost-utility analysis alongside a multicenter clinical trial in patients with rectal cancer. For a sample of 179 patients from 49 hospitals, data on hospitalizations, outpatient visits, medications, and care products during the first year after treatment were obtained from the patients by questionnaire or diary. For all patients, hospitals were contacted for information on hospitalizations and outpatient visits. For a subsample of 94 patients, 86 pharmacists and 10 suppliers of stoma care products were contacted for information on medications and care products. RESULTS: Response by providers of care was high, ranging from 84% to 100%. With respect to hospital days and outpatient visits, we found no significant differences between patients' and providers' reports. For medications and care products, agreement was lower, with providers reporting up to 2 times more product types and costs than patients. Providers failed to report 20% to 25% of all products, whereas patients failed to report 50% to 60% of all products. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' reports seem as valid as providers' reports for hospital days and outpatient visits. For medications and care products, we recommend the use of reports from providers of care, whenever feasible, because they much less underestimate volumes and costs than patients.;0
FDG-PET in monitoring therapy of breast cancer.;Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been used successfully for the staging and re-staging of breast cancer. Another significant indication is the evaluation of therapy response. Only limited data are available on the use of FDG-PET in breast cancer after radiation therapy. The same holds true for chemotherapy. Only the therapy response in locally advanced breast cancer after chemotherapy has been investigated thoroughly. Histopathological response could be predicted with an accuracy of 88-91% after the first and second courses of therapy. A quantitative evaluation is, of course, a prerequisite when FDG-PET is used for therapy monitoring. Only a small number of studies have focussed on hormone therapy. In this context, a flare phenomenon with increasing standardised uptake values after initiation of tamoxifen therapy has been observed. More prospective multicentre trials will be needed to make FDG-PET a powerful tool in monitoring chemotherapy in breast cancer.;0
An integrated two-level hierarchical system for decision making in radiation therapy based on fuzzy cognitive maps.;The radiation therapy decision-making is a complex process that has to take into consideration a variety of interrelated functions. Many fuzzy factors that must be considered in the calculation of the appropriate dose increase the complexity of the decision-making problem. A novel approach introduces fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) as the computational modeling method, which tackles the complexity and allows the analysis and simulation of the clinical radiation procedure. Specifically this approach is used to determine the success of radiation therapy process estimating the final dose delivered to the target volume, based on the soft computing technique of FCMs. Furthermore a two-level integrated hierarchical structure is proposed to supervise and evaluate the radiotherapy process prior to treatment execution. The supervisor determines the treatment variables of cancer therapy and the acceptance level of final radiation dose to the target volume. Two clinical case studies are used to test the proposed methodology and evaluate the simulation results. The usefulness of this two-level hierarchical structure discussed and future research directions are suggested for the clinical use of this methodology.;0
Mindless or mindful? Radiation oncologists' perspectives on the evolution of prostate cancer treatment.;The evolution of radiation therapy treatment for prostate cancer has been striking over the last 10 years. Advances in brachytherapy (BT), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), and the combination of EBRT + BT have led to improved biochemical and clinical results. This article describes these advances in the context of the treatment decision process. Key to this process is the assignment of patient risk, which is based on the results of conventional radiation dose and techniques. Using the 1992 AJCC palpation staging system, Gleason score, and pretreatment prostate-specific antigen, two different risk assessment algorithms were compared. Both gave comparable approximations of risk, although the single factor high-risk model was superior in differentiating those patients with the highest probability of failing treatment after radiotherapy. Such criteria are the foundation for treatment selection. Objective findings support BT alone or EBRT alone for low-risk patients, high-dose EBRT or EBRT + BT for intermediate-risk patients, and EBRT + androgen deprivation for high-risk patients. In summary, advances in radiation oncology have led to significant gains in prostate cancer control. Clinical prognostic factor-based patient selection is central to the optimization of outcome.;0
Examining the economic impact of restenosis: implications for the cost-effectiveness of an antiproliferative stent.;Over the past decade, coronary stenting has been shown to reduce the rates of angiographic and clinical restenosis compared with conventional balloon angioplasty. Despite these improved outcomes, however, coronary stenting is still hampered by a high incidence of restenosis, with important clinical and economic consequences. Recently, the development of antiproliferative, drug-eluting stents has emerged as a promising solution for the primary prevention of restenosis. This paper summarizes the current evidence on the economic impact of coronary restenosis and explores the potential impact of introducing an antiproliferative stent on the cost-effectiveness of percutaneous coronary revascularization. A decision-analytic model based on current clinical and cost data is used to examine the potential cost-effectiveness of such stents. Although prospectively designed studies will be critical to define the true impact of drug-eluting stents on long-term survival, quality of life, and costs in a broad patient population our decision analytic model suggests that as long as these stents are reasonably priced, they may be cost saving for certain patients and cost-effective for virtually all patients undergoing PCI--at least within the U.S. healthcare system.;0
Single- versus multiple-fraction radiotherapy in patients with painful bone metastases: cost-utility analysis based on a randomized trial.;"BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is an effective palliative treatment for cancer patients with painful bone metastases. Although single- and multiple-fraction radiotherapy are thought to provide equal palliation, which treatment schedule provides better value for the money is unknown. We compared quality-adjusted life expectancy (the overall valuation of the health of the patients) and societal costs for patients receiving either single- or multiple-fraction radiotherapy. METHODS: A societal cost-utility analysis was performed on a Dutch randomized, controlled trial of 1157 patients with painful bone metastases that compared pain responses and quality of life from a single-fraction treatment schedule of 8 Gy with a treatment schedule of six fractions of 4 Gy each. The societal values of life expectancies were assessed with the EuroQol classification system (EQ-5D) questionnaire. A subset of 166 patients also answered additional questionnaires to estimate nonradiotherapy and nonmedical costs. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Comparing the single- and multiple-fraction radiotherapy schedules, no differences were found in life expectancy (43.0 versus 40.4 weeks, P =.20) or quality-adjusted life expectancy (17.7 versus 16.0 weeks, P =.21). The estimated cost of radiotherapy, including retreatments and nonmedical costs, was statistically significantly lower for the single-fraction schedule than for the multiple-fraction schedule ($2438 versus $3311, difference = $873, 95% confidence interval [CI] on the difference = $449 to $1297; P<.001). The estimated difference in total societal costs was larger, also in favor of the single-fraction schedule, but it was not statistically significant ($4700 versus $6453, difference = $1753, 95% CI on the difference = -$99 to $3604; P =.06). For willingness-to-pay between $5000 and $40 000 per quality-adjusted life year, the single-fraction schedule was statistically significantly more cost-effective than the multiple-fraction schedule (P< or =.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with multiple-fraction radiotherapy, single-fraction radiotherapy provides equal palliation and quality of life and has lower medical and societal costs, at least in The Netherlands. Therefore, single-fraction radiotherapy should be considered as the palliative treatment of choice for cancer patients with painful bone metastases.";0
Recommendations for implementation of high dose rate 192Ir brachytherapy in developing countries by the Advisory Group of International Atomic Energy Agency.;PURPOSE: To provide recommendations for the implementation of high dose rate (HDR) 192Ir brachytherapy technology in developing countries. METHODS: An Advisory Group Meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) met to address the implementation of HDR 192Ir brachytherapy technology in developing countries. These recommendations reflect only the personal opinions of the authors and do not necessarily represent the opinion of the IAEA. RESULTS: An HDR treatment system should be purchased as a complete unit that includes the 192Ir radioactive source, source loading unit, applicators, treatment planning system, and control console. Infrastructure support may require additional or improved buildings and procurement of or access to new imaging facilities. A supportive budget is needed for quarterly source replacement and the annual maintenance necessary to keep the system operational. The radiation oncologist, medical physicist, and technologist should be specially trained before HDR can be introduced. Training for the oncologist and medical physicist is an ongoing process as new techniques or sites of treatment are introduced. Procedures for quality assurance (QA) of patient treatment, and the planning system must be introduced. Emergency procedures with adequate training of all associated personnel must be in place. CONCLUSIONS: The decision to select HDR in preference to alternate methods of brachytherapy is influenced by the ability of the machine to treat a wide variety of clinical sites. In departments with personnel and budgetary resources to support this equipment appropriately, economic advantage becomes evident only if large numbers of patients are treated. Intangible benefits of source safety, personnel safety, and easy adaptation to fluctuating demand for treatments also require consideration when evaluating the need to introduce this treatment system.;0
Relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values for proton beam therapy.;"PURPOSE: Clinical proton beam therapy has been based on the use of a generic relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.0 or 1.1, since the available evidence has been interpreted as indicating that the magnitude of RBE variation with treatment parameters is small relative to our abilities to determine RBEs. As substantial clinical experience and additional experimental determinations of RBE have accumulated and the number of proton radiation therapy centers is projected to increase, it is appropriate to reassess the rationale for the continued use of a generic RBE and for that RBE to be 1.0-1.1. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Results of experimental determinations of RBE of in vitro and in vivo systems are examined, and then several of the considerations critical to a decision to move from a generic to tissue-, dose/fraction-, and LET-specific RBE values are assessed. The impact of an error in the value assigned to RBE on normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) is discussed. The incidence of major morbidity in proton-treated patients at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) for malignant tumors of the skull base and of the prostate is reviewed. This is followed by an analysis of the magnitude of the experimental effort to exclude an error in RBE of >or=10% using in vivo systems. RESULTS: The published RBE values, using colony formation as the measure of cell survival, from in vitro studies indicate a substantial spread between the diverse cell lines. The average value at mid SOBP (Spread Out Bragg Peak) over all dose levels is approximately 1.2, ranging from 0.9 to 2.1. The average RBE value at mid SOBP in vivo is approximately 1.1, ranging from 0.7 to 1.6. Overall, both in vitro and in vivo data indicate a statistically significant increase in RBE for lower doses per fraction, which is much smaller for in vivo systems. There is agreement that there is a measurable increase in RBE over the terminal few millimeters of the SOBP, which results in an extension of the bioeffective range of the beam in the range of 1-2 mm. There is no published report to indicate that the RBE of 1.1 is low. However, a substantial proportion of patients treated at approximately 2 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE)/fraction 5 or more years ago were treated by a combination of both proton and photon beams. Were the RBE to be erroneously underestimated by approximately 10%, the increase in complication frequency would be quite serious were the complication incidence for the reference treatment >or=3% and the slope of the dose response curves steep, e.g., a gamma(50) approximately 4. To exclude >or=1.2 as the correct RBE for a specific condition or tissue at the 95% confidence limit would require relatively large and multiple assays. CONCLUSIONS: At present, there is too much uncertainty in the RBE value for any human tissue to propose RBE values specific for tissue, dose/fraction, proton energy, etc. The experimental in vivo and clinical data indicate that continued employment of a generic RBE value and for that value to be 1.1 is reasonable. However, there is a local ""hot region"" over the terminal few millimeters of the SOBP and an extension of the biologically effective range. This needs to be considered in treatment planning, particularly for single field plans or for an end of range in or close to a critical structure. There is a clear need for prospective assessments of normal tissue reactions in proton irradiated patients and determinations of RBE values for several late responding tissues in laboratory animal systems, especially as a function of dose/fraction in the range of 1-4 Gy.";0
Choosing an optimal radioimmunotherapy dose for clinical response.;"Clinical trials have documented the single-agent efficacy of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in lymphoma, and several combination therapy studies are now in progress. RIT agents are currently becoming generally available for clinical use in lymphoma therapy. Solid tumors, which are notoriously less responsive to any single agent, have demonstrated clinically useful responses, albeit temporary, and multimodality studies have been instituted. However, a sincere debate continues regarding the basic parameters to be used to define appropriate therapeutic dosing when using this modality in clinical cancer care. It is a good time to reevaluate relevant dose response information from preclinical and clinical RIT. Preclinical studies have demonstrated abundant evidence of dose response in tumor and normal tissue in homogenous model systems; however, substantive variation occurs between the dose responses of tumors with low and variable (or shed) antigen expression, as well as between histologically different tumor models. Clinical studies of various heavily pretreated patient populations given several very different RIT pharmaceuticals have led to disparate conclusions regarding patient dosing methods and dosimetric predictions of toxicity and efficacy. Single-study data on previously untreated lymphoma patients with similar histology has demonstrated a correlation of imaging dosimetry with toxicity and tumor response. High-dose therapy with bone marrow support has also demonstrated a high tumor response rate and nonmarrow normal organ toxicities that correlate with the calculated dose to those organs from imaging. In iodine-131 ((131)I)--anti-CD20 studies, (131)I was demonstrated to have variable excretion, and estimated total-body radiation dose from tracer study proved a predictive surrogate for marrow toxicity. Yttrium-90 ((90)Y)--anti-CD20, which has little (90)Y excretion from the body, demonstrated the injected dose per body weight to be more predictive of marrow toxicity than indium-111 ((111)In) tracer dosimetry methods in heavily pretreated patients, and showed maximal safety with standard mCi/kg therapy dosing. Variations in clinical RIT choices, dosing methods, and dosimetry methods emphasize the need to review the relevant information to date. Future clinical trial designs, the sophistication of dosimetry, treatment planning, and clinical treatment decisions should all be focused on achieving the best benefit-risk relationship for each patient.";0
Economic analysis of the TAX 317 trial: docetaxel versus best supportive care as second-line therapy of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.;PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness (CE) of second-line docetaxel compared with best supportive care (BSC) in the TAX 317 trial, a randomized clinical trial of second-line chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer. METHODS: A retrospective CE analysis of the TAX 317 trial was undertaken, evaluating direct medical costs of therapy from the viewpoint of Canada's public health care system. Costs were derived in 1999 Canadian dollars, and resource use was determined through prospective trial data. RESULTS: The incremental survival benefit in the docetaxel arm over BSC was 2 months (P =.047). The CE of docetaxel was $57,749 per year of life gained. For patients treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2), the CE was $31,776 per year of life gained. In univariate sensitivity analyses, CE estimates were most sensitive to changes in survival, ranging from $18,374 to $117,434 with 20% variation in survival at the recommended dose. The largest cost center in both arms was hospitalization, followed by the cost of drugs, investigations, radiotherapy, and community care. BSC patients had fewer hospitalizations than patients in the chemotherapy arm and were more often palliated at home. CONCLUSION: Although the decision to treat should not be based on economic considerations alone, our CE estimate of $31,776 per year of life gained (at the currently recommended dose of docetaxel) is within an acceptable range of health care expenditures, and the total costs of therapy are similar to those of second-line palliative chemotherapy for other solid tumors.;0
Technical aspects of internet-based knowledge presentation in radiotherapy.;Three-dimensional radiotherapy planning is a complex and time-consuming optimization process which requires much experience. To simplify and to speed up the process of treatment planning as well as to exchange experience and therapeutic knowledge, the department of Medical Physics at the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) in Heidelberg is developing an Internet-based 3D Radiotherapy planning and Information System (IRIS). IRIS designed internet-based client-server application, implemented using Java, CORBA and PVM. The concept of IRIS combines the functionality of an interactive tutorial with a discussion forum, teleconferencing tool and an atlas of dose distributions. Furthermore an integral knowledge-based system provides automatically generated, preoptimized treatment plans. This paper explains the technical design of the system and gives an overview of experiences gained by the technical realization of a first prototype using currently available internet technology. The prototype is currently running for testing in the intranet of DKFZ.;0
A clinical comparison of different film systems for radiotherapy portal imaging.;Portal films are an important tool for verification of the shaping and positioning of external radiation fields to the target volume in radiotherapy. One limitation of port films is their inherent lack of contrast, which is due to the low attenuation of the exposing megavoltage radiation by the tissues being imaged. Recently, Kodak introduced a new portal film-cassette system, Kodak EC-L, with much improved contrast compared with conventional film. The aim of this study was to determine if the enhanced contrast of the Kodak EC-L system actually provides better clinical results. To simulate clinical use, port films were taken using an anthropomorphic phantom that was artificially shifted and/or rotated by a predetermined distance. Identical images were taken using a conventional port film system (AGFA-Gevaert Curix MR4 in lead-lined cassette) and the Kodak EC-L system. Twelve different operators (6 physicists and 6 radiation therapists) were asked to diagnose the problem from a total of 20 port films (10 per treatment site), allowing for direct comparison of the 2 types of films. While the diagnosis of the field displacement improved using the Kodak film, it did not speed-up the decision-making process. It was also found that experienced operators were more accurate at evaluating the films. The results indicate that, for the situations studied (head and neck, pelvis), the Kodak system exhibits better contrast and leads to improved decision making.;0
Recursive partitioning for prognostic grouping of patients with clinically localized prostate carcinoma.;BACKGROUND: Patients treated with radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate carcinoma present considerable heterogeneity in terms of disease free survival outcome. Multiple studies have attempted to create prognostic groupings of these patients in the perioperative phase, using information available regarding several clinicopathologic variables. Such groupings allow physicians to make early yet prudent decisions regarding adjuvant combination therapies. The current study presents results from a statistical analysis that enables the natural identification of such prognostic groups. METHODS: Examination of consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens was performed between January 1991 and December 1995 at Wayne State University, Harper Hospital, Detroit, Michigan. Disease free survival in a cohort of 485 of these men was analyzed using recursive partitioning and amalgamation technique. Clinicopathologic parameters evaluated included age, race, preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, clinical and pathologic stage, and Gleason grade of the fine-needle biopsy as well as the radical prostatectomy specimen. RESULTS: A binary decision tree representation was generated for classifying patients based on the clinicopathologic variables mentioned earlier. The worst prognosis was for patients with either advanced stage and a PSA level > 24.1 ng/mL or advanced stage, a PSA level </= 24.1 ng/mL, and age </= 65 years. This group had an estimated median disease free survival of only 10.3 months. Patients with lower pathologic stage, prostatectomy Gleason scores of </= 7, and a preoperative PSA level </= 22.7 ng/mL had the best prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The recursive partitioning analyses allows easy characterization of a patient for prognosis shortly after radical prostatectomy. This will enable a physician to make more prudent decisions regarding whether to employ watchful waiting, proceed with accepted adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy or hormonal therapy), or refer patients to a research center that is able to administer experimental adjuvant therapy.

Multi-objective optimization in radiotherapy: applications to stereotactic radiosurgery and prostate brachytherapy;Treatment planning for radiation therapy is a multi-objective optimization process. Here we present a machine intelligent scheme for treatment planning based on multi-objective decision analysis (MODA) and genetic algorithm (GA) optimization. Multi-objective ranking strategies are represented in the L(p) metric under the displaced ideal model. Goal setting, protocol satisficing and fuzzy ranking of objective importance can be incorporated into the decision scheme to assimilate clinical decision making. For distance measures in the L(p) metric, a dynamic gauge function is defined based on the state energy of the decision system, which is assumed to undergo thermodynamic cooling with iteration time. The MODA scheme interacts with a robust GA engine, which adaptively evolves in the multi-modal landscape that defines the treatment plan quality. A conventionally challenging case of stereotactic radiosurgery of a brain lesion was selected for GA optimization. The resulting dose distributions are compared to human-developed plans, which are commonly regarded as clinically relevant and empirically optimal. The GA-optimized plans achieve substantially better sparing of critical normal neuroanatomy surrounding the brain lesion while respecting the preset constraints on tumor dose uniformity. In addition, machine optimization tends to produce novel treatment strategies which complements expert knowledge. The run time for producing an optimal plan is considerably shorter than the typical planning time for human experts, thus GA can also be used to aid the human treatment planning process. In prostate brachytherapy, MODA-GA was specifically applied to non-ideal conditions in which typical surgical uncertainties in seed implant positioning occur, where noisy objectives were introduced into the optimization scheme. The noisy system is found to be manageable by MODA-GA at uncertainty levels corresponding to reasonably proficient surgery teams. In contrast, noisy objectives would be very difficult to explore by human expert planners. Potential use of noisy optimization with time series analysis is being explored for error-corrective computer guidance in the operating room for prostate seed implantation. In conclusion, the combination of MODA and GA optimization offers both a solution to practical treatment planning tasks and the potential for real time applications in radiotherapy.;0
Cost utility analysis of prophylactic pamidronate for the prevention of skeletal related events in patients with advanced breast cancer.;Metastatic bone disease is a common complication of advanced breast cancer. Recently, the results of a large randomized placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that monthly pamidronate infusions reduce the incidence of skeletal related events in these patients. In the current study, a cost-utility analysis was performed from a Canadian health care system perspective to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of pamidronate in patients with advanced breast cancer. Twenty-five advanced breast cancer patients who were bisphosphonate naYve and had developed skeletal related complications were identified. Total hospital resource consumption was then collected for all patients. This included direct costs for hospitalization and costs for radiation treatment to bone, surgery, analgesics, blood products, diagnostic imaging, paramedical services and all related physician fees. Treatment preferences were estimated from a random sample of 25 women selected from the general population and 25 female health care professionals, using the Time Trade-Off technique. The outcomes were then generated through a decision-analytic model. Over a 12-month period, total costs in the pamidronate arm were approximately 44% higher than those in the no-treatment alternative (Can$ 9,180 vs Can$ 6,380). When treatment preferences were incorporated into the analysis, the results of the decision model revealed an incremental pamidronate cost of $18,700 per quality-adjusted life year gained. The results of the sensitivity analysis suggested that this estimate was dependent on the cost of treating skeletal related events, particularly bone surgery. Even though pamidronate has a high drug acquisition cost, the results of the cost-utility analysis suggest that this agent does provide patients with a substantial quality-adjusted survival benefit at a reasonable cost to the Canadian health care system.;0
Intraoperative optimized inverse planning for prostate brachytherapy: early experience.;PURPOSE: To demonstrate the feasibility of an intraoperative inverse planning technique with advanced optimization for prostate seed implantation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We have implemented a method for optimized inverse planning of prostate seed implantation in the operating room (OR), based on the genetic algorithm (GA) driven Prostate Implant Planning Engine for Radiotherapy (PIPER). An integrated treatment planning system was deployed, which includes real-time ultrasound image acquisition, treatment volume segmentation, GA optimization, real-time decision making and sensitivity analysis, isodose and DVH evaluation, and virtual reality navigation and surgical guidance. Ten consecutive patients previously scheduled for implantation were included in the series. RESULTS: The feasibility of the technique was established by careful monitoring of each step in the OR and comparison with conventional preplanned implants. The median elapsed time for complete image capture, segmentation, GA optimization, and plan evaluation was 4, 10, 2.2, and 2 min, respectively. The dosimetric quality of the OR-based plan was shown to be equivalent to the corresponding preplan. CONCLUSION: An intraoperative optimized inverse planning technique was developed for prostate brachytherapy. The feasibility of the method was demonstrated through an early clinical experience.;0
A pragmatic implementation of medical temporal reasoning for clinical medicine.;In most development tools for knowledge-based systems object-property-value-triples are the basic ontological representation. We have extended this approach for temporal reasoning by replacing the values with time-objects. A time-object is a combination of a value with a time-point or a time-interval. By preserving the object-property-value-triples basic artificial intelligence techniques can be applied without modifications in the temporal case. The greater complexity of temporal inferences is compensated by a blackboard control architecture enabling small knowledge-sources. The control of the strategic reasoning is in accordance with the select and test model. A prototype of a knowledge-based advisor for the acute radiation syndrome has been implemented and partially evaluated. Due to the affected proliferative tissues it is a strongly time-oriented medical domain.;0
The effect of T cell depletion with Campath-1M on immune reconstitution after chemotherapy and allogeneic bone marrow transplant as treatment for leukaemia.;The prophylactic use of T cell depletion (TCD) strategies for the prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains widespread. Initial reports of high incidence of graft rejection after TCD BMT led to a move away from this approach but improved conditioning regimens have reduced this risk substantially. The use of TCD has also been associated with higher relapse risk post-BMT although the success of donor leukocyte infusion (DLI) as treatment for relapse has reduced this problem, especially in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Currently the use of TCD BMT is increasing particularly due to the relative increase in BMT from non-related donors for whom TCD is the optimal GVHD prophylaxis. However, doubts remain over the long-term effect on the reconstituted immune system of recipients of TCD BMT, particularly in adult recipients. In this study we have undertaken a detailed sequential analysis in 23 patients who received allo-grafts from HLA-identical sibling donors after high-dose chemo/radiotherapy for acute or chronic leukaemia. Of these patients, 11 received non-manipulated grafts, five received 'partially TCD' (PTCD) and a further seven received 'fully TCD' (FTCD) bone marrow. T cell depletion was performed ex vivo by Campath-1M plus autologous serum as a source of complement. Partial TCD describes grafts with a T cell reduction of 1-2 log. Full TCD refers to grafts with a reduction of >2.5 log. The decision regarding the optimal degree of TCD was clinical and was based upon the perceived relative risk of relapse based upon the disease and remission status. All patients were monitored for up to 12 months post-BMT with regard to reconstitution of T and NK cell subsets. T cell depletion at either level was associated with a slower recovery of CD4 cells. This was most marked in the FTCD recipients and lasted throughout the period of study. CD8 cell recovery was also slower in the TCD recipients but this normalised throughout the 12 months post-BMT. The ratio of CD45RA+:CD45RO+ increased in all recipients after month 3. This suggests that a degree of extra-thymic T cell maturation can occur in recipients of allogeneic BMT. NK cell recovery was more rapid in the TCD recipients and these differences were maintained throughout the first year.;0
Surgery versus stereotactic radiosurgery for small, operable cerebral arteriovenous malformations: a clinical and cost comparison.;OBJECTIVE: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) may cause stroke and death in young patients. For small AVMs, the major curative treatment options are surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery (SR). Although the initial costs and risks of SR are less, there is a latency to cure and ultimately the success rate is lower than with surgery. Thus, these two treatment modalities were compared with respect to clinical outcomes and associated costs by means of a cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed using Smltree software (J.P. Hollenberg, Roslyn, NY). Probability estimates for cure and complications for both therapies were derived from the literature. Utility values for minor and major stroke were measured in patients with AVMs who were treated at the University of Toronto clinic, using the standard gamble technique. Costs were obtained from several sources, including the case costing systems of several hospitals in Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: Surgery confers a 0.98 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) advantage over SR, at an additional cost of $6937 per patient. Thus, from a societal perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is $7100 per QALY for a patient treated surgically. The result is sensitive to only two variables: surgical morbidity and surgical mortality. However, the preferred treatment strategy changes to favor SR only at the extreme high end of the possible range for these variables, when the rate of permanent neurological morbidity resulting from surgery exceeds 12% or the surgical mortality rate exceeds 4%. CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of small AVMs, surgery confers a large clinical benefit over SR. The reason is that surgery protects the patient from hemorrhage earlier and with greater success than does SR. The associated cost-effectiveness ratio, $7100/QALY, is highly economically attractive. Therefore, surgery achieves important improvements in clinical outcomes and is associated with an excellent ratio of incremental costs per QALY gained.;0
Multiobjective decision theory for computational optimization in radiation therapy.;"Machine-guided iterative optimization in radiation oncology requires ordinal or cardinal ranking of competing treatment plans. When the clinical objectives are multifaceted and incommensurable, the ranking formalism must take into account the decision maker's tradeoff strategies in a multidimensional decision space. To capture the decision processes in treatment planning, a multiobjective decision-theoretic scheme is formulated. Ranking among a group of candidate plans is based on a generalized distance metric. A dynamic metric weighting function is defined based on the state energy of the decision system, which is assumed to undergo thermodynamic cooling with iteration time. The decision maker is required to specify a baseline ranking of the objectives, which is taken to be the ground state of the decision system. This decision-theoretic formalism was applied to idealized cases in stereotactic radiosurgery and prostatic implantation, using the genetic algorithm as the optimization engine. The optimization pathways and the outcome at limited horizons indicated that the combined scheme of decision-theoretic steering and iterative optimization was robust and produced treatment plans consistent with the user's expectation. The effect of treatment uncertainties was simulated using imperfect objectives; however, certain recurring plans could be identified as optimized baseline solutions. Overall, the present formalism provides a realistic alternative to complete utility assessment or human-guided exploration of the efficient solution set.";0
Prognostic factors and prognostic staging system for small cell lung cancer.;This study was performed to assess the prognostic factors and the predictors of long-term (3-year) survival in patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung, accrued in one randomized trial, and to define patient subgroups showing significantly different survivals using recursive partitioning and amalgamation analysis. A total of 300 patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung were entered into a randomized study comparing cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and vincristine (CAV), cisplatin and etoposide (PE) and alternating treatments of CAV and PE. Of these, 286 patients were analysed for the present study of prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis showed that poor performance status (2-3) (P = 0.0001), extensive disease (P = 0.0015) and abnormally elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.0001) and alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.0013) were independently adverse pretreatment prognostic factors. Of limited disease patients, performance status (P = 0.029) and white blood cell count (P = 0.044) had a significant influence on the probability of 3-year disease-free survival. Using recursive partitioning and amalgamation analysis, three classes of similar prognosis were identified: the most favorable class was defined by knowledge of lactate dehydrogenase (normal), performance status (0-1) and serum sodium levels (normal) with median survival time of 16.0 months, and the class with the poorest prognosis was defined by knowledge of lactate dehydrogenase (elevated) and performance status (2-3) (median survival time 6.6 months). The intermediate class had a median survival time of 9.4 months. In conclusion, this subclassification system will be used for the design, implementation and interpretation of clinical studies as well as decision-making in individual patients.;0
Acceptability and usage patterns of an image analysis workstation.;Critical to the successful deployment and use of new computer systems is the acceptance of the system by the users, i.e., the clinicians. We describe a study which evaluated, in an experimental setting, the potential acceptability of an image analysis workstation for radiation therapy. The acceptability and usage patterns were measured using semi-structured questionnaires and maintaining logs of user interactions. The results of the study showed that the radiation oncologists, who were the subjects for the study, perceived the workstation as acceptable. The results also suggested several areas for improvement of workstation that could increase its acceptance in the clinical setting.;0
An observer study for direct comparison of clinical efficacy of electronic to film portal images.;PURPOSE: To directly compare clinical efficacy of electronic to film portal images. METHODS AND MATERIALS: An observer study was designed to compare clinical efficacy of electronic to film portal images acquired using a liquid matrix ion-chamber electronic portal imaging device and a conventional metal screen/film system. Both images were acquired simultaneously for each treatment port and the electronic portal images were printed on gray-level thermal paper. Four radiation oncologists served as observers and evaluated a total of 44 sets of images for four different treatment sites: lung, pelvis, brain, and head/neck. Each set of images included a simulation image, a double-exposure portal film, and video paper prints of electronic portal images. Eight to nine anatomical landmarks were selected from each treatment site. Each observer was asked to rate each landmark in terms of its clinical visibility and to rate the ease of making the pertinent verification decision in the corresponding electronic and film portal images with the aid of the simulation image. RESULTS: Ratings for the visibility of landmarks and for the verification decision of treatment ports were similar for electronic and film images for most landmarks. However, vertebral bodies and several landmarks in the pelvis such as the acetabulum and public symphysis were more visible in the portal film images than in the electronic portal images. CONCLUSION: The visibility of landmarks in electronic portal images is comparable to that in film portal images. Verification of treatment ports based only on electronic portal images acquired using an electronic portal imaging device is generally achievable.;0
Clinical extracts of biomedical literature for patient-centered problem solving.;This paper reports on a four-part qualitative research project aimed at designing an online document surrogate tailored to the needs of physicians seeking biomedical literature for use in clinical problem solving. The clinical extract, designed in collaboration with three practicing physicians, combines traditional elements of the MEDLINE record (e.g., title, author, source, abstract) with new elements (e.g., table captions, text headings, case profiles) suggested by the physicians. Specifications for the prototype clinical extract were developed through a series of relevance-scoring exercises and semi-structured interviews. For six clinical questions, three physicians assessed the applicability of selected articles and their document surrogates, articulating relevance criteria and reasons for their judgments. A prototype clinical extract based on their suggestions was developed, tested, evaluated, and revised. The final version includes content and format aids to make the extract easy to use. The goals, methods, and outcomes of the research study are summarized, and a template of the final design is provided.;0
START: an advanced radiation therapy information system;"START is an advanced radiation therapy information system (RTIS) which connects direct information technology present in the devices with indirect information technology for clinical, administrative, information management integrated with the hospital information system (HIS). The following objectives are pursued: to support decision making in treatment planning and functional and information integration with the rest of the hospital; to enhance organizational efficiency of a Radiation Therapy Department; to facilitate the statistical evaluation of clinical data and managerial performance assessment; to ensure the safety and confidentiality of used data. For its development a working method based on the involvement of all operators of the Radiation Therapy Department, was applied. Its introduction in the work activity was gradual, trying to reuse and integrate the existing information applications. The START information flow identifies four major phases: admission, visit of admission, planning, therapy. The system main functionalities available to the radiotherapist are: clinical history/medical report linking function; folder function; planning function; tracking function; electronic mail and banner function; statistical function; management function. Functions available to the radiotherapy technician are: the room daily list function; management function: to the nurse the following functions are available: patient directing function; management function. START is a departmental client (pc-windows)-server (unix) developed on an integrated database of all information of interest (clinical, organizational and administrative) coherent with the standard and with a modular architecture which can evolve with additional functionalities in subsequent times. For a more thorough evaluation of its impact on the daily activity of a radiation therapy facility, a prolonged clinical validation is in progress.";0
Increasing patient involvement in choosing treatment for early breast cancer;Background: This investigation examined factors affecting patient involvement in consultations to decide local treatment for early breast cancer and the effectiveness of two methods of preconsultation education aimed at increasing patient participation in these discussions. Methods: Sixty patients with Stage I or II breast cancer (1) were pretested on their knowledge about breast cancer treatment and optimism for the future, (2) were randomly assigned to one of two methods for preconsultation education: interactive multimedia program or brochure, (3) completed knowledge and optimism measures, (4) consulted with a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and general surgeon, and (5) completed self-report measures assessing their involvement in the consultations and control over decision-making. The consultations were audiorecorded and analyzed to identify behavioral indicators of patient involvement (question-asking, opinion-giving, and expressing concern) and physician utterances encouraging patient participation. Results: College-educated patients younger than 65 years of age were more active participants in these consultations than were older, less educated patients. In addition, patients showed more involvement when they interacted with physicians who encouraged and facilitated patient participation. The method of education did not affect patient involvement although patients tended to learn more about breast cancer treatment after using the multimedia program than after reading the brochure. Conclusions: Although patients vary in their expressiveness, physicians may be able to increase patient participation in deciding treatment by using patient-centered behavior. Also, preconsultation education appears to be an effective clinical strategy for helping patients gain an accurate understanding of their treatment options before meeting with physicians.;0
The cumulative verification image analysis tool for offline evaluation of portal images.;"PURPOSE: Daily portal images acquired using electronic portal imaging devices contain important information about the setup variation of the individual patient. The data can be used to evaluate the treatment and to derive correction for the individual patient. The large volume of images also require software tools for efficient analysis. This article describes the approach of cumulative verification image analysis (CVIA) specifically designed as an offline tool to extract quantitative information from daily portal images. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The user interface, image and graphics display, and algorithms of the CVIA tool have been implemented in ANSCI C using the X Window graphics standards. The tool consists of three major components: (a) definition of treatment geometry and anatomical information; (b) registration of portal images with a reference image to determine setup variation; and (c) quantitative analysis of all setup variation measurements. The CVIA tool is not automated. User interaction is required and preferred. Successful alignment of anatomies on portal images at present remains mostly dependent on clinical judgment. Predefined templates of block shapes and anatomies are used for image registration to enhance efficiency, taking advantage of the fact that much of the tool's operation is repeated in the analysis of daily portal images. RESULTS: The CVIA tool is portable and has been implemented on workstations with different operating systems. Analysis of 20 sequential daily portal images can be completed in less than 1 h. The temporal information is used to characterize setup variation in terms of its systematic, random and time-dependent components. The cumulative information is used to derive block overlap isofrequency distributions (BOIDs), which quantify the effective coverage of the prescribed treatment area throughout the course of treatment. Finally, a set of software utilities is available to facilitate feedback of the information for treatment plan recalculation and to test various decision strategies for treatment adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: The CVIA tool provides comprehensive analysis of daily images acquired with electronic portal imaging devices. Its offline approach allows characterization of the nature of setup variation for the individual patient that would have been difficult to deduce using only a few daily or weekly portal images. Distribution of the tool will help establish an important database of setup variation from many clinics. The information derived from CVIA can also serve as the foundation to integrate treatment verification, treatment planning, and treatment delivery.";0
Interventional telemedicine for noninvasive neuroradiosurgery: remote-site high-performance computing, mathematical optimization, and virtual scenario simulation.;Interventional Telemedicine may have potential utility in providing connectivity and access to specialized high performance computing and advanced software resources in support of clinical procedures in the field of Minimally-Invasive Surgery and Stereotactic Linear Accelerator (LINAC) Radiosurgery. Such interventions may benefit from application of nonlinear quadratic inverse solution methods designed to provide the capability to reverse optimize a 'best case' treatment plan. The formidable decision-making challenges posed by increasingly complex optimized data and progressively versatile LINAC delivery systems require volume visualization of projected treatment data and imaging anatomy via photorealistic rendering and virtual scenario simulation techniques. Both these new directions are heavily dependent on access to specialized high performance computing platforms solely accessible via broad-bandwidth network connectivity. This pilot project presents resimulation of retrospective radiosurgical case data using inverse solution optimization models running on workstation clusters and then volume rendered and simulated on the Princeton Graphics Engine Supercomputer. Evidence for effective utilization of such optimization and virtual simulation methods running on remotely accessed, distant high performance computing resources is discussed in view of the potential for long-term clinical investigation and eventual development of Interventional Telemedicine as a clinically practical approach for providing support to remote or non-urban radiosurgery centers in the industrialized and developing world.;0
Design and evaluation of a subclassification system for supraglottic laryngeal cancer.;The management of supraglottic laryngeal cancer is predicted upon tumor staging as determined by the American Joint Committee Classification (AJCC). Because of changes in both radiotherapy and surgical treatment, the current AJCC may lack the detail and specificity required for accurate selection of treatment. An expanded classification system should provide predictive information that would aid in clinical decision making. Using the AJCC as a foundation, a subclassification system based upon existing knowledge of laryngeal anatomy, embryology and pattern of tumor spread was developed. This system identifies those cancers that involve subsites deemed to represent regions of increased risk for spread. The validity of this subclassification system and its clinical application was assessed by reviewing 139 cases of supraglottic laryngeal cancer and performing a statistical analysis with respect to treatment outcome. The results of this study support the conclusion that two subpopulations of laryngeal tumors, those with a subsite designation of infrahyoid epiglottis, and those demonstrating fixation of the vocal cord, may benefit from a more aggressive treatment protocol.;0
The Oncology Clinical Information System;This presentation provides an overview of the functions of the Oncology Clinical Information System (OCIS) focusing on three new applications. The first part of the presentation will describe the structure of OCIS and show the basic clinical decision-support aspects of the system on-line. The second part of the presentation will provide on-line demonstrations of three new applications: a sophisticated blood products ordering systems, a chemotherapy and treatment scheduling system, and a radiation therapy scheduling system.;0
Knowledge-based computer systems for radiotherapy planning;Radiation therapy is one of the first areas of clinical medicine to utilize computers in support of routine clinical decision making. The role of the computer has evolved from simple dose calculations to elaborate interactive graphic three-dimensional simulations. These simulations can combine external irradiation from megavoltage photons, electrons, and particle beams with interstitial and intracavitary sources. With the flexibility and power of modern radiotherapy equipment and the ability of computer programs that simulate anything the machinery can do, we now face a challenge to utilize this capability to design more effective radiation treatments. How can we manage the increased complexity of sophisticated treatment planning? A promising approach will be to use artificial intelligence techniques to systematize our present knowledge about design of treatment plans, and to provide a framework for developing new treatment strategies. Far from replacing the physician, physicist, or dosimetrist, artificial intelligence-based software tools can assist the treatment planning team in producing more powerful and effective treatment plans. Research in progress using knowledge-based (AI) programming in treatment planning already has indicated the usefulness of such concepts as rule-based reasoning, hierarchical organization of knowledge, and reasoning from prototypes. Problems to be solved include how to handle continuously varying parameters and how to evaluate plans in order to direct improvements.;0
"Endometrial cancer: therapeutic decision and the staging process in ""early"" disease.";An all inclusive, widely accepted system for correlation of indices of pathophysiology in endometrial cancer with a spectrum of therapeutic management has yet to be developed. Improved understanding of tumor growth should lead to more logical, individualized treatment especially in terms of irradiation. To support these philosophies a brief review of past reports and studies, especially the Endometrial Adjuvant Study is provided. From an analysis of 574 patients in this study, it is apparent that prognostic factors could be separated as major, differentiation, and tumor penetration and minor, number of capsules of radium and depth of uterus. A pilot study under the Gynecologic Oncology Group suggests the correlation of the major factors with lymph node involvement. Since depth of penetration and lymph node involvement are most accurately determined by surgery and pathology, surgical staging is suggested as a guide for therapeutic decision.;0
